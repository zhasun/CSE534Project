Message-ID: <CC75EEBF17C7374EA8309102B7B10C84012D6A5942@exchange.shenrons-house.local>

I am seeing heavy packet loss passing through Atlanta on Level 3 destined to NationalNet (AS22384).  Actually, 100% packet loss to this specific destination.  Also Internet Pulse is showing some rage for Level3.  Anyone else able to confirm this?  Source within Source is AS13736 and destination within 173.0.75.0/24 (AS22384).  Sourcing from AS7922 traffic looks correct.

It's a specific issue between one of our down steams and Blake network.  Not a network related issue.

Subject: [outages] AAAA for www.att.net broken?
Message-ID: <003401cf69e9$b165d0d0$14317270$@iname.com>

I monitor ICMPv6 and HTTPv6 access to www.att.net, and starting at 1:26 am
Central I started getting no IPv6 address for that host.  (Because of ATT's
TTLs the DNS change may have happened earlier but our monitoring system
didn't see that).

It now has two CNAMEs, neither of which resolves to an IPv6 address.
www.att.net used to resolve to 2001:1890:1c01:2::40.  The IPv4 version goes
to att.yahoo.com, which does work.

If anyone from ATT/Akamai/Yahoo is lurking, could they look into this?

Regards,

Frank Bulk

Denver endpoint in case it wasn't clear from the traceroute. Could you 
elaborate on the issues you're seeing?

The problem I've been seeing is specifically with service connectivity. 
I'm on the Toronto, ON tunnel. Pings and traceroutes complete without 
any problems, however as soon as services (specifically mail-related, 
IMAP and SMTP) were run across the tunnel, they would time out and fail. 
I'm just looking to see if anyone else has noticed something similar 
over the past few days.

Hmmm, looks like you might be on to something. From HE6in4:

root at alpha:~# for i in `dig mx gmail.com +short | cut -d' ' -f2` ; do 
printf "%-25s%-25s" "`date '+%x %X'`" "`dig AAAA $i +short`" ; e=`curl 
-6 -sSm 5 $i:25 2>&1 >/dev/null`; r=$?; echo "$e $r" ; done

 From native IPv6:

root at test:~# for i in `dig mx gmail.com +short | cut -d' ' -f2` ; do 
printf "%-25s%-25s" "`date '+%x %X'`" "`dig AAAA $i +short`" ; e=`curl 
-6 -sSm 5 $i:25 2>&1 >/dev/null`; r=$?; echo "$e $r" ; done
05/07/2014 11:14:29 AM   2607:f8b0:4001:c03::1a    0

05/07/2014 11:14:29 AM   2607:f8b0:400c:c01::1a    0
05/07/2014 11:14:30 AM   2a00:1450:400c:c05::1b    0
05/07/2014 11:14:30 AM   2a00:1450:4013:c00::1a    0

No issues with IPv6 web traffic though. Anyone else seeing this?

FWIW, through Fremont with a BGP tunnel:

Seems to work OK for me from my home location (2620:0:930::/48 AS1734).

Just another datapoint. As Reid mentioned, the folks at support at he.net are in the best position to help you resolve any issues.

I'm just looking to see if anyone else has noticed something similar over the past few days.

Yes, through Dallas in particular...to the point where I finally just
disabled it.  Tried again a few minutes ago, and the latency is so high and
throughput so low that I immediately turned it right back off.

Took over a minute to load my Gmail inbox with the tunnel...not sure what
the issue is.

Our NAGIOS logs show no response, starting at 4:10 am (Central), and then at
4:39 am it was "Service unavailable" until 6:02 am.

Here's a current traceroute and my logs.

Cogent has had a issue for a few days now, causing extreme latency across
the network;

I have a 100Mb Cogent fiber line out of downtown Syracuse, NY and are not experiencing any issues.

 

But their tech support has always been pretty good, you should reach out to them again.

The !H indicates host unreachable.  I'm guessing that some router near the
host has a 4.5 second ARP timeout.  It's not a latency issue, but probably
an end host issue.

Above is the full traceroute.  What I find is pinging the end route you'll
see it jump up to 10000MS and down to 9000MS.  Almost like a bad BGP
upstream.

Here's a trace to that same location over Cogent out of Denver and it all is 
fine here - except for the last hop and that's most likely them blocking me:

I read this traceroute to indicate two things (return-path would be nice
but gotta work with what I got):

The routers at hop #11 (I see it varies due to load balancing per
packet) claim that the destination, 38.101.32.14, is unreachable (i.e.
you are getting back ICMP host-unreach from those routers).  That could
mean either they don't have a route for whatever 38.101.32.14 falls
under (network-wise), or that the routers are aware that 38.101.32.14
isn't reachable/alive (god forbid they have a /32 for it)

You might wonder "what's up with hop #11 then 'doing it again' at hop
#12?", and the answer is probably that the routers at hop #11 are
supposed to have knowledge/reachability of/to 38.101.32.14, but don't
(for whatever reason), and are configured by default to punt packets
back to another router to try and find a different path (i.e. bouncing
between 154.54.28.82 and 154.54.5.161, hoping one can find the thing
the other cannot).

TL;DR -- You should be talking to both Cogent, as well as whoever
maintains this video.primelink1.com service/server/network, to inform
them of what's going on.  It's obvious something somewhere is either
broken or administratively set to behave this way.

Charter Communications is experiencing a voice service degradation on
their SIP & PRI circuits. CBNOC indicates this is a nationwide issue.
We have been experiencing trouble in northern Michigan since ~13:00
ET.

It looks like it affected service out of their Fitchburg, WI head-end as well.  We have SIP service out of that head-end and we received a rash of helpdesk tickets about voice degradation on calls that we routed via Charter.  Our degraded call times ranged from 11:45 through 13:06 CDT.

Charter master ticket CIT# 5861904
Not resolved.
Mitigated at 2:20 ET

I've heard: Congested circuits in the St. Louis, MO area resulted in
(potentially ongoing) packet loss. Further, call management systems
responded to the packet loss by passing calls between backup systems
resulting in further degradation and dropped calls.

We are seeing issues with secureserver.net in the midwest. Symptoms include
slow response times, DNS timeouts, and registrar functions seem to be
unavailable.  Whois database appears to be impacted as well.  Is anyone else
experiencing these symptoms...??

"Bad file descriptor" could indicate the TCP socket is being abruptly
closed by the remote end (server), or probably a timeout; hard to say on
Windows (no offence of course).

Let's see from *IX:

$ curl -L -v http://www.secureserver.net/

^C

And from that point it just sits there -- no response to TCP SYN;
tcpdump verification:

I have no idea what "proper" behaviour is (i.e. no idea if the HTTP 302
is normal, no idea if default.secureserver.net is the normal FQDN
redirection destination, no idea if the IPs in question are correct
(e.g. DNS hijacking, whatever)), just proving some technical insight.

Subject: [outages] Google Resolver 8.8.8.8 Selectively responding to RDNS requests
Message-ID: <9AC13097-E9B0-4C7A-8470-5042A617A34C@gmail.com>

I have a /24 in an Internap colo and use Google Resolver 8.8.8.8 on all my machines. Google will not consistently respond to RDNS lookups from source IP X.X.X.1 but will respond consistently if I change the IP address of the machine to X.X.X.2. I have proven the DNS response is never returned using tcpdump.
It's positively not a local networking issue as changing my resolver to 4.2.2.2 (Level 3) while the machine uses X.X.X.1, the RDNS responses arrive without fail.

Has anyone else seen this sort of selective response by Google? Do they maintain some sort of black list?

I would suggest it is probably more load balancing by hashing the
source IP address then a black hole.

Hmm interesting, good point, never thought of that. 

If that is the case, then the conclusion would be that this issue is affecting more than just my X.X.X.1 but rather all source IPs whose hashed value is the same as my X.X.X.1?

It's unlikely the hashing is that simple.

Also, you should check to ensure your .1 isn't being abusive.

You should at least be using 8.8.4.4 for some of your queries, does it work?

I've heard problems with Verizon OC12 and loss of power in CO in the McLean, VA / Tysons corner area.
This was detected yesterday afternoon and seems to still be a problem with, I know at least Ethernet circuits.

Anyone else affected by this?
Checking for validity here.

Great, I agree that it is because traffic from x.x.x.1 is taking a different path than x.x.x.2 likely because of a load balancing technique which has some dependency on source ip. I?ve posted the issue in Google?s issue tracker. Thanks for the help!

I'm hearing second-hand that Sprint is having a "large data outage".  Our
wireless carrier's data partner, ClearSky, apparently uses them in some
manner.

Anyone know anything?  First report I received was just after 9:30 am
Central.
