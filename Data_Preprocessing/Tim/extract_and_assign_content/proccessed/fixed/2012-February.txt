Came right back up, so no issues.

A couple of customers reported they have been down since 2:00.  One says he
was told it was due to a manual change from their primary upstream to their
secondary.  What, no BGP?!?  No ETA and their web site claims no outages at
this time.

Has anyone out there heard of any ATT OptiMAN problems in the
Southeastern Michigan region? We have some circuits down and I've been
having a hard time getting through to anyone. All the hold time makes me
think there're a lot of calls which makes me think maybe there is a
bigger issue going on.

 

These are just OptiMAN point-to-point links, nothing fancy...

I'm seeing a total outage at Bandwidth.com on their CORE 2 network for all incoming and outgoing SIP traffic.

Anybody else?  So much for redundant IP's and switches on CORE 2?..

We are seeing signaling, but no audio.  Looks like they are making progress? albeit slow.

I show two originating AS numbers:

#sh bgp ipv4 uni 67.231.4.195
BGP routing table entry for 67.231.4.0/24, version 116524879

Anyone else see the same thing? We have notified both 4323 and 33363.
I checked both RIPE RIS and HE's bgp toolkit and both indicated that
12130 is the correct origin AS.

I think it layer 7 issue.    Before it went completely south it was throwing exceptions when looking up a tracking number.

Made the local news blog here several hours ago.  It ends with "UPS,
based in Atlanta, expects the disruption to be cleared up soon."  I
don't know what their definition of "soon" is though (overnight
express?).

Just got word at 13:04 PST that UPS has stated they've resolved the
issue.  Can't give any more details than that (and I don't have an
RCA/RFO).

If folks could re-verify their www.ups.com transactions (tracking, etc.)
and follow-up that would be great.

Just got word at 13:04 PST that UPS has stated they've resolved the issue.  Can't give any more details than that (and I don't have an RCA/RFO).

If folks could re-verify their www.ups.com transactions (tracking, etc.) and follow-up that would be great.

I can (slowly) load www.ups.com, but tracking doesn't work.  Following
the Tracking link takes me a page with "/not_there" in the URL; I knew
the package is not there yet, that's why I was trying to track it! :-)

Negative... The main site is up via Qwest, but the tracking boxes embedded in 
pages (main page for instance) are non-existant. The main tracking URL 
http://www.ups.com/WebTracking/track?loc=en_US cycles between "page not 
found" and and an error reference code, like Daniel reported.

Again -- can't provide any details, but there are indications that yes,
some pieces of infrastructure are still not working correctly.  UPS is
still actively engaged in solving all of this.  Sorry folks, wish I
could provide more, but can't.

Was a final RFO ever posted? Was this something that bandwidth.com did
"wrong", or was it because someone started announcing their prefixes?

Bandwidth informed us yesterday morning that the issue is closed.   They
issued a formal RFO that puts blame squarely on "another transport
provider" that was broadcasting their routes and they worked with this
unnamed provider.

Message-ID: <CAJGHyrF0q-g6-S-_toFymbrzRqd6V4Dag8cm+5aUbi0gSWJTPA@mail.gmail.com>

This isn't an outage per say, however it is a pretty major reduction
of service availability that we've seen, and perhaps other folks on
this list have seen something similar.

Since literally 00:00:00 2012/01/01 our Origin Bandwidth Offload has
been slowly dropping. Prior to 01/01, we were seeing 97% offload from
our origin servers (not bad!)

Midnight 01/01/2012 Origin offload dropped to 95% and has been slowly,
steadily dropping since. Today we've reached a new low of 88%.

We've contacted Akamai and so far we've received very little feedback
about the cause, or why this happened so dramatically at midnight on
January 1st. Our origin infrastructure has not changed before or after
01/01.

THe lack of willingness to investigate on Akamai's end has caused me
to reach out to this list.
Has anyone else experienced something similar? If so would you please
contact me directly? I would love to hear your situation.

Thank you very much,

- S

I've seen something similar whereby HTTP attack traffic which has been deliberately constructed to be non-cacheable has been relayed from a CDN to the targeted site.

Have you looked into your HTTP query details in order to see if you're getting lots of queries which stand out in that regard vs. your regular traffic?

Another possible cause would be changes to a site itself which results in more non-cacheable dynamic content which can't be served via the CDN.

So far we have seen, all requests have been legit. Our content is very
static binary files, which makes this a little more confusing. It
almost feels like our service has had its expiry adjusted on the
Akamai side, causing our content to expire faster than it use to from
edge servers. Or perhaps a new customer has come in and is taking over
the majority of the cache on these same servers? Impossible to tell,
and not information Akamai wants to share with other people.

Thank you all for your contacts. I'll be happy to hear anything else
anyone wants to suggest.

Hello list,

Has anyone else had or heard about Level3 outages in San Francisco?  The MSP we get connectivity from has had 4 outages to us in the past 36 hours and I have a feeling they may be blowing smoke when they tell us it's been regional L3 outages.  If anyone can cite issues with L3 in SF (specifics below)  or a lack thereof, I'd appreciate it.

The MSP/network in question seems to hang off of [interface].car1.SanFrancisco1.Level3.net

Here are the times we have seen issues (Eastern):
Yesterday 1912-1932
Today 0745-0809
Today 1737-1834

Thanks - if you are local to the router mentioned above, any indication about whether or not you have seen issues would be appreciated.

AfriNIC is busy with maintenance on their whois (and a few other things)
this weekend:

I will however forward this on to the relevant people so that they are

A little late to the party, but here is what I know.

Around 1:30 PM ET yesterday (2/17/2012) both of our T1 circuits at our
Canadian site in Edmonton went down. Shortly after that a voice
circuit at the same site went down.

Our voice vendor quickly confirmed that there was a regional issue.
Later our data circuit vendor confirmed that there was a cable cut in
Alberta. All of our circuits have been up since midnight, however word
is that work continues on the cable cut.

Yes, but that can't be "trusted". Trust me... at least not for these impairments where it is not a full outage.

I think SFDC is pretty transparent with this stuff on that status web
page.  In fact, sometime last year (I don't remember when), there was a
degradation in email-to-case delivery (similar to what you are
describing today) and it was reported on the Trust web page.

Right... they are transparent but when the official notice is 4 hours later than we report.... They are transparent but it took them a long-time... :)

advanceautoPARTS.com seems to be the real domain, works fine for me, and
goes to Akamai.

advanceauto.com is the same company, but I'm guessing was just a redirector
to the above.
