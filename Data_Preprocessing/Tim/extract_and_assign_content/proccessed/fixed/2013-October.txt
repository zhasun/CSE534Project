Subject: [outages] Sidera/Lightower outage at 111 N. Canal Chicago
Message-ID: <524B2101.3000301@blastcomm.com>

We saw our Sidera Ethernet circuit loose physical connectivity at 111 N. 
Canal around 1:30pm.  After several failed calls to the Sidera NOC, when 
I finally got through the queue was over 20 calls long.  I'm guessing 
that there is some sort of network issue going on, but have not seen any 
notices either here or from Sidera.  Just wondering if any others are 
seeing issues with Sidera/lightower in Chicago.

The issue started happening today again.  It sounds like Netflix is having
some challenges with advertising AAAA's that are operating.  When
www.netflix response I get three AAAA's that on AWS East.  When it's not
working, I get eight AAAA's that are on AWS West.

Here's the three AAAA's when it's good and the eight AAAA's when it's not
good.

Friday evening, Sunday morning, and Sunday evening, our monitoring system
has seen sporadic HTTPv6 access issues to www.netflix.com.  Starting since
10:36 am Central this morning, I've seen sporadic ICMPv6 failures to
www.netflix.com.

Now www.netflix.com has many AAAA records that are likely different around
the world and I don't have our monitoring system set up to individually
monitor each AAAA record, but wondering if anyone else has seen the same
thing?

Regards,

Frank

================
Current AAAA's, currently pingable:

2406:da00:ff00::b849:f83b
2406:da00:ff00::b849:fcb3
2406:da00:ff00::6b16:ebed

Confirmed from my POV in Texas, as well as v6 servers in NY, FL, and IL.

As a consumer, I've had to straight up disable IPv6 when I want to watch
Netflix.

Message-ID: <CAPC+kK4K4fKyD52zSaXKUROkdzuVFS40FFQJ_3AuRK-tYKix5w@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone seeing any sprint issues? I just had every device of ours(well the
company I work for)across the country drop off. Sprint rep mentioned a
nationwide EVDO outage started in the last hour. Anyone have more info or
seeing the same issue?

Subject: [outages] Comcast in Silicon Valley -- Oakland or thereabouts just broke?
Message-ID: <20131002235434.GA66985@icarus.home.lan>

This just happened -- looks like something in Comcast's network within
Oakland broke, reconverged (quickly and seamless), but issues remain.

Ren Provo et al, if you're lurking, might want to make someone aware of
this (if they aren't already).  :-)

Not just Oakland - I'm seeing issues in both the South Bay as well as on
the Peninsular so I'm guessing it's pretty much the whole SF Bay Area.

Same symptoms as you're seeing - packet loss that seems to be within their

Acknowledged.

I'm in Mountain View but you can clearly see where the reconvergence
takes place in the mtrs (between Oakland and SF Sutro, at least from the
forward path).  Naturally I have no way of knowing where the actual
issue is.

I'm sure you know by now most of our (as a customer) packets get sent
either down to San Jose or out of Oakland (and I believe the Oakland
network is something that got rolled out somewhat recently; I remember
seeing it suddenly appear in my mtrs one night not that long ago).

I sent a tweet to @ComcastCares pointing them to this thread.

I also imagine the issue will get worse since it's now 1700 and people
are just starting to get off work...

Sadly for us at Comcast, that is correct.

Subject: [outages] AOL MX inbound servers failing?
Message-ID: <524ECA23.4000309@boniface.me>

Hello everyone:

For the last few days I've been noticing mail queuing on our mail 
servers with errors like this:

(delivery temporarily suspended: host 
mailin-03.mx.aol.com[205.188.190.2] refused to talk to me: 421 
mtain-df04.r1000.mx.aol.com Service unavailable - try again later)

The errors are transient, as forcing delivery tends to send them 
through. It's happening on many mail servers so it isn't a DNSBL problem 
on our end.

Has anyone else noticed this?

Thanks,
Joshua Boniface

This looks like greylisting on AOL's part.  You can Google the term and
read lots about it; it's a fairly common anti-spam tactic, but the
downsides to it are quite major (my opinion from running a hosting org
for ~18 years).

I've been maintaining this site

with power outage maps and links to utility company outage
web sites nation-wide. I thought it might be something that
this outages list would find of interest.

If there's a similar page somewhere with outage or status information
links and examples for internet carriers I haven't seen it all collected
in one place, let me know if I'm missing something.

We have two Zayo/Abovenet fiber links down right now in Chicago. We just talked to them, and they are aware of the issue, but don't have an ETR. Anybody here know anything, or seeing the same issue?

Message-ID: <CAPRZce0DqM2RLpbBz2PWqh91S1RqjPoaKSo2u4FKjOyN1G=ivw@mail.gmail.com>

Here's a roundup of stories from the media; the outage affects
multiple states including Michigan, Ohio, Georgia, Oklahoma, and
others that use ACS (a division of Xerox) as their processor for EBT
transactions.

http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2013/10/ebt-systems-down-in-multiple-states-michigan-bridge-card-not-working-.html

I've sent a note to the Xerox PR contact in the hopes of pinning them
down to whether it's a power outage, a software update, or a telecom
issue that is the root cause.

thanks

Ed

and the PR statement from Karen Arena of Xerox:

"During a routine test of our back-up systems Saturday morning,
Xerox?s Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) system experienced a
temporary shutdown. While the system is now up and running,
beneficiaries in the 17 affected states continue to experience
connectivity issues to access their benefits. This disruption impacts
EBT beneficiaries who rely on the system for SNAP and WIC. Technical
staff is addressing the issue and expect the system to be restored
soon.  Beneficiaries requiring access to their benefits can work with
their local retailers who can activate an emergency voucher system
where available. We appreciate our clients? patience while we work
through this outage as quickly as possible"

Message-ID: <CAPC+kK53Eu9n8p==0mMcUaCDV+snyT0sRtsSnF1FizxbY3vdrg@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone else having issues on Static IP's with the newer Netgear modems?

I work in a NOC for a MSP/Reseller and we currently have about 15 down
across the country. They didn't all go down at the same time but in
"chunks" like 5 went down within 4 minutes of each other.

National Accounts confirmed to me a known issue affecting the
Netgears. Has anyone else gotten further details?

I also did note that it doesn't seem to affect the few netgears we
have bridged(passing the public IP via DHCP to our router). In
addition on the few that i had a backup link I was not able to ping
the Static IP of the modem/Gateway(which is on the modem). So I am
wondering if its a config issue. But it does look to be only STATIC
customers.

Ok so from some off list replies and a post i made on DSL reports it
seems we are most definitely not the only ones affected. From what
National Accounts has told me if a remote reset/reboot from the CMTS
didn't fix it they were told to send a truck.....So I had to set up 11
truck rolls.. most today.. some were pushed to the 23rd....needless to
say the ones that far out were escalated.

Comcast hasn't given me any good info in regards to the EXACT issue,
but my hunch as well as others seems to point to a botched firmware
and/or config push.

Mitch,

I have Time Warner Cable Business Class here in Cleveland, and was hit with what sounds like a similar issue on Saturday.  Ubee cable modem, static IPs.  Tier 3 tech said that they couldn't get routing working correctly.  Had to reflash the modem about 10-12 times to get it to work.  The guy was about to roll a truck, but then tried one last thing and got it flashed and working.  I'll call TWCBC and ask for them to pull the notes on the ticket and see if there's anything in there that could be useful.

Are the issues with routing or do you not know?

Thanks,
Chris Egeland

Sorry for double email. But also Comcast could NOT see the modems as
online so they can't do much of anything remotely to it. So i am
leaning more and more toward a bad firmware flash turning them into
pretty close to bricks.

I'm not the only one, either.
http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/delta.com also shows down.

Been getting a log of web sites simply send 'reset' this morning and a
lot of slow connections. Something going on in the SE U.S. in general
this AM?

THANKS!

I'm not the only one, either.
http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/delta.com also shows down.

Been getting a log of web sites simply send 'reset' this morning and a
lot of slow connections. Something going on in the SE U.S. in general
this AM?

THANKS!

http://delta.com/ loads for me from here [1] and includes the following, which might help explain any problems people are seeing:

"On Thursday, June 27, we will be performing system maintenance on delta.com beginning at 3am EDT. We expect this maintenance to last approximately one (1) hour. During this time you will be unable to access delta.com or many transactional areas of our mobile applications.
We apologize for any inconvenience."

When troubleshooting these types of things, try www.$FOO. For instance:

	Tigger-rBook:~ patrick$ host delta.com
	delta.com has address 205.174.16.50

	Tigger-rBook:~ patrick$ host www.delta.com
	www.delta.com is an alias for www.delta.com.edgekey.net.
	www.delta.com.edgekey.net is an alias for e7648.b.akamaiedge.net.
	e7648.b.akamaiedge.net has address 23.34.8.216

That first IP address will be the same for everyone. The second one will not. Plus the first one just redirects to the second (hostname, not IP address, obviously).

Just an update we are seeing most of them back online now. Some
"unofficial" RFO from the techs i've spoken with was a bad firmware
push and the fix was to push the old one back and have the modems
powered down for about 5 minutes and plugged back in.

I just opened a ticket with L3.

I've been having packet loss since 9:07AM today over my L3 circuit.

I am in Philly and L3's customer access router is experiencing high packet loss.

I just opened a ticket with L3.

I've been having packet loss since 9:07AM today over my L3 circuit.

I am in Philly and L3's customer access router is experiencing high packet loss.

Same issue seen from Cablevision's network this morning. Traceroutes seem to die after reaching edge2.newark1.level3.net for me.

I was seeing similar things going through Cogent, but I suspect it's asymmetrical routing with the return traffic coming in via Level 3.

Newark, huh?

C'mon guys, we know you're crazily celebrating being the most recent state

Level3 just called me back for the ticket I filed. Tech was very knowledgable. Is aware of the issue (obviously) and has attached my ticket to the master event ticket so that I can see realtime updates.

Appears the ETA is within the next 2 hours.

I just opened a ticket with L3.

I've been having packet loss since 9:07AM today over my L3 circuit.

I am in Philly and L3's customer access router is experiencing high packet loss.

Using road runner in Brooklyn NY.

Cant access certain sites ( Facebook, twitter, citibank) . All of them have one thing in common, they go thru level3.

I just opened a ticket with L3.

I've been having packet loss since 9:07AM today over my L3 circuit.

I am in Philly and L3's customer access router is experiencing high packet loss.

Hardware failure and apparently the part that was sent to fix was also broke...  This is from the most recent update to the ticket.

The Transport NOC has reported that the field technician completed rerouting traffic; however, some services failed to restore. The replacement circuit pack is still in transit to the site, and an emergency maintenance window has been scheduled for 04:00 GMT<x-apple-data-detectors://3> to perform the replacement. Once the circuit pack is replaced, customers will be reverted to the original route. All services will be impacted while traffic is being routed back. The next update will be sent once it has been confirmed that the maintenance activity has commenced, or should any additional information become available.

Thanks Tim and Darrell, these updates are priceless for us, since the provider we use to connect to Level3 still seems to be totally clueless about the issue.

 

Would you mind sharing the Level3 master ticket # so we can raise their awareness?

 

If you receive any further updates, especially confirmation of issue resolution, it would be wonderful if you post that to this list, too.

 

Thanks again.

As of approximately 8 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time Monday, Facebook appears to have gone into read only mode for somewhere between most and all users, per Mashable and other news sources via Twitter.

Status postings and comments are ignored from the web client, from the Android client, and from third-party Android apps, at least.

More as this story develops.

Same Problem (Germany), it really seems to be a global/large scale problem.

Wall street journal is already on it.

The articles seem to only mention status updates; however, acknowledging

The articles seem to only mention status updates; however, acknowledging dialogues and other such "write" tasks are also nonfunctional.

I can confirm that they are also having issues with their prepaid 
platform affecting at least some MVNO's.

Good afternoon Outages,

Anyone else seeing massive DNS issues this morning, particularly with
Network Solutions' "hosted zone" servers?

langsam:~# whois carywiedemann.com | grep "Domain servers" -A 3
   Domain servers in listed order:

   NS43.WORLDNIC.COM            205.178.190.22
   NS44.WORLDNIC.COM            206.188.198.22

langsam:~# host carywiedemann.com 206.188.198.22
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

Seems to be affecting far more than just my personal domain:

langsam:~# whois blueridgenetworks.com | grep -A 3 "Domain servers"
   Domain servers in listed order:

   NS23.WORLDNIC.COM            205.178.190.12
   NS24.WORLDNIC.COM            206.188.198.12

langsam:~# host blueridgenetworks.com 206.188.198.12
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

langsam:~# whois blueridge.com | grep -A 3 "Domain servers"
   Domain servers in listed order:

   NS33.WORLDNIC.COM            205.178.190.17
   NS34.WORLDNIC.COM            206.188.198.17

langsam:~# host blueridge.com 206.188.198.17
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

I don't believe any of these NSXX.WORLDNIC.COM servers are anycasted...  is
anyone else having trouble?

Not a peep out of their Twitter feed.

Thanks everyone.

"Looks like Network Solutions is having some issues, folks, so if your
domain is registered there, you may notice some issues with loading."

Getting through to them might be hard, per @arcstv:

"@donavenSWP: @netsolcares All Network Solutions listed phone numbers
busy. Thousands of sites down. Nice that their site is up. Frack!"

Cary,
confirmed.  I have several clients that are 'still' using the native Netsol
DNS and they are all down now.  I am not seeing anything from any social
feeds with any updates from NetSol, but I have not had much luck with them
during events like this either.  It would be nice if they could be
responsible enough to even put a blurb out on the social feeds so guys like
us are not left "wondering" about the magnitude of the outage.

Here is to DNS migrations next week!!

Robert,
I finally found the twitter info right after I hit send.  Of couse the time
stamp on what I found was minutes old and My team had been addressing this
with our clients for over an hour at that point.  Thanks for the serving of
crow, I shall consume it humbly.

I saw the same problems yesterday, Nagios complained for 1 hour 48 minutes
between 12:15pm EDT and 2:03pm EDT that a site whose DNS is hosted by
NetSol was down. The IP responded fine, but the hostname was having issues
resolving.

It wasn't a full outage, secondary DNS was responding when tested manually,
and primary was responding sometimes, but often with large enough of a
delay that Nagios gave up trying to resolve it. But not down enough for
most resolvers to ask the secondary.

Looks like it recovered about 22 minutes after you emailed the list.

Their @creativecloud twitter account is still posting normally like nothing is wrong, but they do have a notice on their help site that says:

---
Customers are currently unable to sync fonts or access their files online in Creative Cloud. We're working to restore service as soon as possible.

It?s been down for at least 45 minutes now. Beyond what the above message says, you also can?t download or update anything you have a subscription for.

Sign in error for my VZW Droid Mini. Google Voice is queuing text messages (unsure about voice calls) and Hangouts is continually trying to send the message.

Nothing showing on google's apps status dashboard.

errors are you seeing on what
application?

Nexus 4 on T-Mobile.

Google voice doesn't seem to work and I get the "please try again later" message when trying to login to my Google account on the device.

Cautious optimism...seems to be fixed.  Gmail and Google (search page) are
working for me.  Packet loss seems to be between 0 and minimal.

Josh,

What does that mean?  You and your tech support are taking issue with TWC and Akamai?

If you are having some type of trouble and expecting some help, providing details of where you are, what type of connectivity and who you are connected to and what services you are experiencing trouble with is imperative. Your message provides none of those. Traceroutes, MTRs, or other relevant details are highly encouraged. 

Regards,
Andrew Koch

Time Warner Cable had an issue with Akamai in Chicago.  I was just letting

Message-ID: <20131026034903.GA98233@icarus.home.lan>

Here's another one of these incredibly annoying situations that baffles
me (and of course figuring out who's responsible is not something I have
the power to do).

Been watching this one happen every day, usually between the hours of
1700 and 2000 PDT (UTC-0700).  Packet loss and latency lasts anywhere
between 30 to 75 minutes.  From today around 1915:

What interests me: hops #6 and #7 shown in the first mtr:

80.156.163.154 = AS3320 = Deutsche Telekom AG

Two final things to note:

1. When the packet loss/latency issue is not occurring (e.g. presently),
the paths are still the same.  If packets were actually going from
Sunnyvale (Layer42) to Germany I'd expect a lot higher than 4ms-7ms
latency consistently,

2. The source/destination of 204.8.213.80 is a box at my place of work;
border of network intentionally filters.  We do peer with Layer42
directly, but I have not pursued this with them yet (as said initially,
it's hard for me to accurately point fingers).

DT sells transit services in the US as AS3320.   So I would say there is congestion on the link between Comcast and DTAG in San Jose.  If Layer42 is your uplink I would let them know because it is very likely they have a paid relationship with DTAG.

Message-ID: <20106063.2693.1382761645223.JavaMail.root@benjamin.baylink.com>

I'm seeing, tonight, the inability to resolve DNS lookups for *some* domains,
from my Sprint 4G phone.  FB and Twitter are fine, and Currents can get to 
Android Central, frex, but panther.baylink.com, where my weather page resides,
won't resolve, as won't tapemonster.com, www. and en.wikipedia.org, and a
few others.

There seems no particular rhyme or reason to it.

Perhaps those zone servers are more than 600mi away?  :-)

(I have logged into one of my Linux boxen, *through* the 4G connection,
and did dig+trace from there; panther.baylink.com resolves just fine that
way.  And, for the record, the 4G link lets me ping panther by IP just fine; 
this appears to be solely DNS, and not all of it.)

Started around 1800EDTish, I think.

Anyone else seeing anything like this?

Cheers,

A little late notice...

Looks like there was a power outage in BT's NYC 111 8th DC around 10PM EST last night. Story to-date is procedures weren't followed during an IR scan maintenance window.

I've been hating on Comcast this past week, because
they keep losing connectivity to the outside world in
Palo Alto for 3-5 minutes at a time.  When it happens,
I can traceroute towards places like google, make it
5 or 6 hops through comcast, at which point it
consistently dies at 529bryant, like this:

I was hoping I wouldn't have order another T1 to the
new house, but it looks like that might be my only
option for stable connectivity.  :(

We do what we can.

But you'll note I said a) that it was happening to many other domains, and b) that my machines in that domain resolved fine from other connectivity.

There are no problems at Google's end.  Without more details (a dns lookup
and a traceroute) my best guess would be malware on your machine.

Subject: [outages] AT&T UVerse down
Message-ID: <CAPRZce173mdELVBY72T-tONKQ+i2QeLwjNB=6U9TPz3xaR=MBw@mail.gmail.com>

Multiple reports from Twitter that AT&T's UVerse is down in multiple
cities. I am away from home working so I can't confirm (I have UVerse at
home).

The Chicago Tribune has a "breaking news" story:

http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-att-uverse-service-outage-20131029,0,5006084.story

By Wailin WongTribune reporter

11:05 a.m. CDT, October 29, 2013

AT&T is working to fix a U-Verse service outage in the Chicago area after a
?software upgrade issue,? the company said Tuesday.

?A limited number of U-verse customers may be experiencing issues with
U-verse services due to a software upgrade issue,? AT&T said in a
statement. ?Technicians have resolved the issue, and service has been
restored for most impacted customers. We expect service to be fully
restored for all customers by early afternoon. We apologize for this
inconvenience.?

   Cool. AT&T's *Uverse* is *down*. And apparently it's *down* everywhere.
   So the ratio of AOL users is higher than normal. Good luck, Twitter.

Bandwidth fell apart at 22:05 UTC, we are not seeing that it is specific to SoCal.  My graphs show recovery at 23:10 to 23:20 UTC (10 minutes ago).
