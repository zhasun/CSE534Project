For those of you with COX or a COX Peer, it seems as though COX has shut
off ICMP transiting their networks.  I do not have a time yet when this
will be fixed.

Has anyone confirmed if this affects all ICMP, or just specific ICMP
types (e.g. echoreq/echorep)?

If they're blocking all ICMP, someone at Cox needs to be fired
immediately.

My Cox Rep confirmed that it indeed being blocked at 'several' of their
peering points.  I have not got a RFO as of yet, but they are initially
blaming it on a "Peering Partner".  My investigation concluded that it
was COGENT (as174) that was the peering partner, yet I do not know who
exactly was at fault, though it didn't sound like it was Cox from my
rep.  They had mentioned that their own monitoring systems were dark due
to the outage. They had mentioned it was ALL icmp being affected.

This affected traffic regardless of destination or source ip address.

Hi, WatchMy.Net is a new community service to alert you when your prefix
has been hijacked, in real-time.

Following the discussion on NANOG a couple of weeks ago on what to do if
your prefix is hijacked, people mentioned that detection-wise, free
services are limited (to certain communities or by not being real-time).

The current fully public and free services will alert you with a few
hours delay.

Over labor day weekend we built a free real-time service. We invite people to 
try it out during our beta stage.

As you know, the main linuxbox.org lists are run on a DSL line inTexas
since 1997. I am so excited about this working for so long, we kept it
there Other lists run on other servers, one of which is kindly hosted by
Vix.

The DSL line will be down Monday between 8 - noon (Dallas time).

Thanks,

There was some mumbling, I believe on Slashdot -- which means its 
confidence level is 0, of course -- that the FBI was involved in this outage.

Anyone willing to admit to anything?

The issue you're referring to (re: Slashdot) is with regards to VP
candidate Sarah Palin's Yahoo! mailbox being compromised, and contents
of that mailbox mailbox being put up on Wikileaks.

Numerous news sources have run article on the break-in.

Wikileaks is either overloaded or has been shut down by the upstream due
to god-knows-what, or by government request.  None of this should come
as a surprise under the circumstances, and I'm also somewhat confused
why a website going down would be outages at isotf.org worthy.

I was just thinking "Why wasn't this posted to NANOG?"

Well, Jeremy, since you didn't notice the Great Renaming of the list... :-)

High-profile websites fall under the scope of the list, as I understand it;
that's a metaphysical definition, I realize, but I suspect that if Virendra 
thinks I need spanked, he'll (or she'll; I'm never sure in non-Murrican 
names) spank me.

Cheers,

I appreciate everyone's concern. I understand the services run on 
linuxbox.org are critical to the well-being of the Internet in some cases, 
and a valued service in other cases.

linuxbox.org is a small box, located in Dallas TX, running behind a DSL 
line. There was an anticipated downtime early Monday after about 2 years 
on the air, which unfortunately was repeated yesterday for about 24 hours.

What are we doing running such services on a DSL line?

While the services run on linuxbox.org are well backed up with very strong 
boxes in very strong locations with multiple upstream providers (the 
backup list for MWP for example is hosted by Vixie), that little box has 
served us well for over 10 years, and I have no intention of moving from 
it. I find the use of a simple box behind a DSL line refreshing in today's 
world where more and more bandwidth is thrown around.

That said, I do realize some of the services can no longer simply be 
"backed up" and will have to be moved to one of our other "strong" 
locations.

Thanks,

Gadi.

I'd be happy to kick in a suitably sized VPS/VM instance, to know that
a resource this useful won't go down for days on end due to improper
hosting arrangements.  Please don't hesitate to contact me off-list if
you're interested...

Your offer is more than appreciated. I mean that. But we have a few boxes 
on very strong links fired up and usable. This one is legacy, and a legacy 
to boot.

We're a major XO shop, IP and voip.  They're whole IP net seems to have been down from about 17:20 EDT to about 17:30 - 17:35 EDT.  I'm sure the echo effects will last a bit as this was pretty major.  I don't know the cause.  It affected data and VoIP as well all over the US.

Trying to call into XO and they aren't even taking calls, they mention 
something about network issues in Spokane. Any ideas as to what is going 
on/ETA to fix?

Little late on my part, but yes... XO partitioned for 20-30 mins today. Said it was a peering issue. I'll share the RFO when I get it.

Subject: [outages] Cox in Wichita
Message-ID: <48D876C0.9000807@justinshore.com>

Portions of Cox in Wichita was down from 21:58 to 23:45 this evening. 
So far the cause has been attributed to a Foundry switch somewhere in 
their network.  I have PtPs between Wichita and a suburb (on Cox's PON 
network in Wichita and dropped out of an ONS in the suburb) and a 
+100Mbps Internet link to a suburb that when down (terminated on a 7600 
in Cox's network and dropped out of the same ONS on the other end).  I 
wouldn't have expected them all to cross the same switch but apparently 
though somehow do.  As of right now they appear to be up and running again.

I guess I was under verbose.  Except paired with a natural disaster,  
geography alone is not a useful "up/down" metric.  "XO in LA" is  
useful. "LA" is not.

Subject: [outages] puck outage this am.
Message-ID: <48DB0B20.9010803@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

You may or may not have noticed puck.nether.net (hosting outages.org
mailing list)  suffered an outage this am. This was caused due to a file
system issue (possible inconsistence state) on a fairly large (1tb)
filesystem
which caused services on puck to be unresponsive.

Many thanks to Jared Mauch in addressing this issue.

Like always, appreciate your feedback and your constructive criticism.


regards,
/virendra

Finally got the RFO:

Summary: On Monday September 22, 2008 at 4:12 PM all XO Peering Routers were isolated due to a mis-configuration caused by human error.  An XO technician inadvertently ran an incomplete script while attempting to complete non-impacting changes on an SNMP filter.  XO data customers were unable to reach external websites following the scripting push.

XO identified the issue immediately and began the process of logging into the Peering routers and corrected the configuration to restore the Peering router connectivity by 5:20 PM.

As of this writing, XO operations is implementing a verification screen prior to script launching to ensure that only the intended scripts are being deployed. In addition, all scripting will require a Scheduled Maintenance Request or Repair event.

Cause: Inadvertent mis-configuration caused by human error
Resolution: XO technicians corrected configuration to restore peering router connectivity.

Little late on my part, but yes... XO partitioned for 20-30 mins today. Said it was a peering issue. I'll share the RFO when I get it.

I don't have full diagnostic skills--it seems to server up a blank page.

They apparently block ICMP as current best practice seems to require.

I tried the same and it took a long time to return - perhaps  
exceeding a browser timeout.

I think virendra called it - load problems.

They can call me for an LVS cluster. ;)

I guess there is some comfort that there are a few people interested in 
the $1.2T Giveaway Bill.

Seems like there is a message in the readiness to serve area tho.

I expect Obama's office to announce a solution momentarily.

I wonder if it's load or config issues.

I get:

  "Bad Gateway"
  "The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server."

when visiting speaker.house.gov.

However judiciary.house.gov and clerk.house.gov come up fine.

I'm sure its a typical enterprise/government announcement.  No prior communication to IT staff, although they will be required to troubleshoot and fix!  As now it appears "broken", although completely avoidable!

Communication and planning - its another foreign policy!

I can confirm that t-mo's gprs/edge service was unavailable approx 25
miles west of detroit from approximately midnight last night until
sometime after 3 pm today. This is based on my observation of my own
t-mo phone; I wasn't keeping a close eye on it or doing any kind of
logging of availability.

I get connected at gsm not grps or edge, so I would say it is down and
their customer service has a message upfront that my area has issues
and they are working on having it back soon...

Ahem.  Who said "block ICMP' is BCP?  Yes, there's some ICMP things that
you probably *should* block if they're to/from untrusted sources, but in
particular, host/net unreachable ICMP shouldn't be blocked, and the next
site I catch blocking 'Frag Needed' I'm gonna get on a plane and re-educate
them with a clue-by-four regarding what they're doing to PMTUD.

I wouldn't say it's "best" practice, but it's "common" practice to drop
all ICMP traffic.  When I worked for a government contractor a few years
ago, we had to fight tooth and nail for them to enable 'Frag Needed' and
'Destination Unreachable' on as many routers/firewalls as possible.
Those changes were needed just so we could get to the point of figuring
out _why_ the network was broken.  Almost every cisco router or firewall
I saw on a government network control started with "any any drop" rule,
and ICMP never had an "accept" rule.  Best practice says drop everything
and permit what you need, most people don't realize how critical ICMP is.

It's been a few years since the "ping death" scares of 1997, do we
really need to stop dropping any ICMP traffic anymore?  My home internet
connection (AT&T DSL) drops not only ICMP Echo, but traceroute requests
as well. I understand that some saturated connections don't want ICMP
Echo requests going through, but in this age of fast processors in
routers we could rate limit instead of drop.  It's hard to determine an
outage is an outage when you can't perform basic connectivity tests.

I've been inactive in the racket for a while but personally think 
blocking any ICMP from or to people you want to talk to is a mistake, 
but last I heard just about everybody was telling me to block _some_ 
ICMP or other for some mythical reason o other.

And the more expensive consultants (considering TCO) and most of the 
"firewall" experts were telling me to block them all.

And occurs to me now that there are one or two places that operate 
routers in RFC 1918 space and some that will not pass traffic that is 
sourced in RFC1918 space.

I used to routinely drop ICMP from outside (at a different employer) because of the use at the time of ICMP as a covert communications channel by Loki and similar malware.  ICMP messages were (are) also very useful for mapping services on a network.

This was before "stateful" packet inspection on ICMP was commonplace, and before ICMP traffic could be selectively blocked by type.

Wouldn't you specifically want source quenches to go through in this  
case?

Qwest has confirmed there are 'ongoing issues in [their] western
region.'

Naturally they won't give any more details than that.

Internal qwest ticket for everyone is 2859983

Firefighters from 6 departments battle blaze at Qwest building in Tukwila

Nearly 75 firefighters from across King County worked together Monday 
afternoon to put out a three-alarm fire in the roof of a Qwest 
Communications building in Tukwila.

By Noelene Clark

Seattle Times staff reporter

Scores of firefighters from across King County worked together Monday 
afternoon to put out a three-alarm fire in the roof of a Qwest 
Communications building in Tukwila.

Nobody was hurt in the fire, started by roofers working with hot tar at 
about 3:45 p.m., said Tukwila Fire Battalion Commander Marty Grisham.

The fire got into the insulation, spreading beneath catwalks and 
air-conditioning systems, he said.

"It was a concealed fire, and those are just really tough," Grisham 
said. "It wasn't a big fire, but it was a very manpower-intensive fire."

Almost 75 firefighters from Tukwila, Seattle, Renton, King County Fire 
District 20, Kent and SeaTac departments were called to help contain the 
fire, he said.

Everyone in the building ? fewer than 10 people ? evacuated, a Tukwila 
fire spokesman said.

Firefighters had to cut part of the roof away to get to the blaze, 
Grisham said. They also ran a salvage operation to rescue computers and 
other expensive equipment from water damage, he said.

"It was very physically demanding," Grisham said.

Several medic units stood by, and teenagers participating in Tukwila's 
Fire Explorers program ran a "rehab station" with food, drinks and 
emergency first-aid equipment to support the firefighters as they 
battled the blaze for more than two hours, Grisham said.

Fire marshals are expected to make a damage estimate Tuesday, he said.
