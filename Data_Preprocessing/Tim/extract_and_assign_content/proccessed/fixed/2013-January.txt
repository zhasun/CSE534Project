Does anyone have any info here? We have no ETA's and they have been down
for over 12 hours. The last person I pryed out of them it might be a fiber
cut. Has anyone else heard anything?

The Rep told me that over 14 nodes are offline.

The website for the Council on Foreign Relations, www.cfr.org<http://www.cfr.org>, has been refusing connections for most of the day today.  Normally I'd chalk it up to random problems, but given the recent watering-hole attack against the site, I thought I'd mention it here and see if anyone had heard anything.

I've had several "looks OK" reports, so it's probably a problem local to me.  I am seeing RST packets apparently from 75.101.137.229, but sometimes someone sets our firewalls to send those instead of silently dropping the traffic, so that could be it.

Thanks, all.

The "good" news is it they must have a backup/protect ring as I have been
able to ping our device but with 300+ms ping times and 50% or more packet
loss but bad enough its more or less down.

Latest update:

Information Update:   This is Windstream emailing the latest status of this
fiber cut.  The splice crew has arrived onsite and will begin splicing
shortly.  There is still no ETA at this time.  We will provide further
updates as they become available.

This went down around 2:45pm Central time today.  Definitely affecting various sites in Illinois.

Something seems to be up at Hostway's facility in Tampa.  We have
servers there that suddenly went dark, tech support's Tampa phone
number is giving a fast busy signal.  I reached someone in Hostway
sales that said they're aware of an issue in Tampa but their office
hadn't been able to reach anyone in the Tampa NOC due to a phone
problem, so no details or ETA.

Starting to see responses back from servers now though ping times are
sometimes normal and occasionally higher than usual, but traffic seems
to be flowing again.

Hostway Tampa appears to be dropping traffic again.

(Hopefully the third try's the charm)

Anybody else seeing connectivity issues reaching Twitter? (AS 13414). I'm seeing a what looks like a Layer 3 portchannel with a misbehaving or downed member link past ae60.pao1-cr1.twttr.com (199.16.159.85). Customer reports started rolling in about 11:30 AM EST yesterday for the main website and t.co.

http://downrightnow.com/twitter also shows problems. I've been trying to get ahold of someone at Twitter's NOC but haven't had any luck so far.

Hi list,

I'm seeing what appears to be a broken Layer 3 or 4 port channel (load balancing) somewhere in Twitter land. I have no idea if this is affecting anyone other than us as searching hasn't yielded anything, and Twitter's status page shows no issues.

At the end of my message I've put some example of what I'm seeing. Behaviour changes based on source/dest IP, based on many customer and infrastructure addresses in different subnets, and a variety of the A records returned for twitter.com. We are multihomed so that might obscure the problem, I've included a sample out our 2nd provider.

The problem appears to be somewhere past ae60.pao1-cr1.twttr.com (199.16.159.85)

If anyone from Twitter is out there please drop me a line... we are AS 23252

If anyone else is experiencing this I'd love to know also

Thanks

Subject: [outages] Twitter connectivity issues?
Message-ID: <20130111101213.8o5zxeae0w8wgoso@webmail.smarthost.org>

Hi list,

I tried to send this yesterday, but after 15 hours I don't see my post, so appologies for any duplicates. 

Customer complaints started rolling in around 11:30 AM EST (GMT-0:500) yesterday, or approx 23 hours ago. I'm seeing what appears to be a broken Layer 3 or 4 port channel (load balancing) somewhere in Twitter land. I have no idea if this is affecting anyone other than us as searching hasn't yielded anything, and Twitter's status page shows no issues. 

At the end of my message I've put some example of what I'm seeing. Behaviour changes based on source/dest IP, based on many customer and infrastructure addresses in different subnets, and a variety of the A records returned for twitter.com. We are multihomed so that might obscure the problem, I've included a sample out our 2nd provider. 

The problem appears to be somewhere past ae60.pao1-cr1.twttr.com (199.16.159.85)

If anyone from Twitter is out there please drop me a line... I've dropped a line to the ARIN NOC contact but haven't gotten a response. We are AS 23252

If anyone else is experiencing this I'd love to know also

Thanks

Wikipedia is moving their Ashburn VA datacenter, 17-01UTC three days in
a row, 22/3/4 January.

Print this out and hang it on the wall you keep such things on, so everyone
will know.

Apologies for the crappy line wrap; I've had 36 RFC-compliance bugs open
on Zimbra for about 4 years now.

Cheers,

Hi list,

Sorry for all that spam - headers show puck.nether.net sat on my messages :(

I got ahold of someone at Twitter and we narrowed it down to an issue related to my upstream provider after all.

Cheers

Hi list,

I'm seeing what appears to be a broken Layer 3 or 4 port channel (load balancing) somewhere in Twitter land. I have no idea if this is affecting anyone other than us as searching hasn't yielded anything, and Twitter's status page shows no issues.

At the end of my message I've put some example of what I'm seeing. Behaviour changes based on source/dest IP, based on many customer and infrastructure addresses in different subnets, and a variety of the A records returned for twitter.com. We are multihomed so that might obscure the problem, I've included a sample out our 2nd provider.

The problem appears to be somewhere past ae60.pao1-cr1.twttr.com (199.16.159.85)

Looks like there is either a rather Large Power outage or Fiber Cut In Hawaii at the moment. I personally have multiple circuits down and Random packet loss to Different Carriers on the Islands. Anyone else seeing anything similar?

I'm seeing degraded paths to Hawaii on our big board.

I can confirm that the ILEC here (Hawaiian Telcom) is/was having 
troubles that're even affecting their POTS.  I no longer have any
insight as to what the trouble is exactly, though, as I haven't 
worked there for a couple of years.

Yep, been down since about 1400 UTC Wednesday 9th Jan. Last I heard is 11th Feb for restoration of a cut 1100km out from Tuas, Singapore toward Perth, Australia.

So how's Australia connectivity to Singapore atm?   One of the ISP's in New Zealand is randomly routing via the US... Telstraclear is generally routing via
Japan/Hong Kong.  But from reading about the Singapore Battle.net server for Starcraft 2, it sounded like Australia has a lot of ISP's with bad Asia routing in
general so may not make much difference.

Google appears to still go to China?

It's actually pretty good to Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Hong Kong generally.

It's India, Pakistan, China etc that aren't so good.

Europe to China is terrible though.  I've got a friend who was asking about remote between UK/China.  And if it's possible to get good routes to there.

And I can't find anyone doing good routing to China from Europe.  I'm sure there's meant to be a cable with a good path?

<joking>Internet 2 and APAN are having a joint meeting in Honolulu. Naturally, it wouldn't be a big meeting of techs without a fiber cut to go with it.

right now it seems to not be able to get to that host at all.

It was acting strange from NL/UK too.. but more like 250 to tokyo.

Curious.  Russia may be even worse.  I must admit I don't know a lot about Europe
routing.  What I did find earlier was that India from UK wasn't too bad, using the
looking glass server of vr.org which has lots of locations.

hmm.. .

so doing the go up at the end thing.  Curiously my mtr I'd left running to Japan
went a bit lower.  i wonder if that is congestion due to the cable break.

if I trace to www.iij.ad.jp it's a bit better

then you still need good connectivity to that host in india though.. best i can do is
trace back to the gateway you were using.

And yeah it's way too high, and oesn't seem to even get to there.

There may be better routes through Pakistan, as I seem to remember that they use
both Asia routes and Europe routes.

Best I can seem to find is Japan <-> India of 125 to 132 msec, India <-> Uk of 161 msec.

And the route from UK to Japan was like 278 to 285 going via new york/los angeles.

That said the Japan traffic to India was going via Singapore, there may be a more direct
path.  And I don't know if 161 is good for India <-> UK.

There's meant to be some new cable between Japan and Europe through Russia, which may help
things.

Between Mumbai (India) and Marseille (France), you have SMW4, TGN-EA,
SEACOM, etc... => about 100ms.
Note: Marseille is at about 21ms of London via Paris.

So far, from UK/France, with cables I've seen in use, you go East via
India to reach: Singapore, Hong-Kong.
But then, to reach Japan, you go West, via North America.

Uk to singapore and Oz go west from uk across both Atlantic and Pacific.
Routes to Oz vary across pacific day on day eithe via japan/singapore or
southerncross cable to nz first

Do you have a traceroute of any of these good routes?  Are they under
200ms or above 300ms?

I've never seen a traceroute between Japan (UTC+9) and either London
(0/+1), Germany (+1/+2) or Moscow (+4 (formerly +3/+4)) that didn't go
through usually both NYC (-5/-4) and SJC (-8/-7).

All in the northern hemisphere, timezone-wise Moscow and Japan are
only 5 hours apart, whereas Moscow and SJC are 12 hours apart right
now, and SJC and Japan are an extra 7 hours.  5 vs. 19? :-)

Actually, there were a couple of weeks when routing between HE.net in
FMT and a RETN.net-based connection in MSK was going through Japan one
way, and it was adding a little extra latency.  As an end-user, that
was the first and only time ever that I had any remote proof of any
internet pipes leaving Russia not through Europe!

https://plus.google.com/101080388381040783378/posts/LY6m7edSe5x

But the traceroute below is representative of about the only route
there is between Europe and Asia:

As if routing between Asia-Pacific and Europe (or even Russia) is any good! :-p

Sorry, we had our fiber cut on Monday. They keep ignoring my emails to avoid cuts during our conferences. ;-)

China telecom among other appears at de-cix. it's my experience that 
paths into china on the transit side are deliberately operated at 
capacity. When I worked for a large electronics manufacturing concern we 
had TDM and/or later l3vpn paths into our network in china from europe, 
one through central asia and another via the middle east, both required 
multiple provider handoffs.

Hello,

First off, thanks for an amazing utility.  This is in no way a gripe or complaint because what you are doing is awesome.  I did want to let you know that we were considering displaying both the outages.org map and list views of open alerts on our NOC dashboard (TV), but really weren't able to because we wanted to be able to save things like filters for types of outages and date ranges after refresh.  It appears that anytime the page is refreshed the view goes back to a 6 month unfiltered view.  I'm sure you can imagine all sorts of awesomeness (Landscape vs portrait orientation etc etc etc) that would be nice, so my only suggestion is to consider unmanned-dashboard type of viewing functionality.  (I feel funny even making a suggestion for something that I don't pay for and already is so awesome, so please take it for what it's worth)

Thanks,

Chris

Sadly, no "real" networks use these routes, and Rostelecom is not
particularly known for having any settlement-free peering in Russia
whatsoever (in the old days, they had all Moscow "interconnects" go
through London).  I know of no non-premium hosting providers in Moscow
that buy transit from Rostelecom.  And no other major telecoms in
Russia seem to have any Moscow-Japan routes that don't go through NA.

Cheers,
Constantine.

I could never understand why no-one built a decent direct cable from
Perth to Europe via Gulf of Aden
A lot of the Asia traffic from AU can still go via U.S. because its much
cheaper.

The stupidest thing Australians do is rely primarily on Sydney for 90%
of int traffic, the cables and Sats out of Perth wont hold up if
terrorists blew the crap out of Sydney points.  Brisbane is the next
best landing point (and technically closer than Syd), but is ignored,
Melbourne pretty much too, though IIRC there is (or was) a cable from
Melbourne to NZ

wiki.outages.org is currently down as / partition was used up to 100% 
causing apache and mysql to choke.

However we may know what may have caused it and in order to address this 
issue we attempted to re-size / partition but we were unable to make the 
VMware see the new size as the dynamic resizing is not supported at the 
moment.

Having said that, we have since created a new VM and looking at 
migrating data over including DNS change. Until this migration takes 
place, wiki.outages.org will be unaccessible.

I apologize for any inconvenience.

Many thanks to Avleen Vig from etsy.com who suggested that I run tune2fs 
to release the reserved blocks to free up disk space which it did about 
5% enough for the system to jump start mysql and viola, wiki came up.

Now off to doing security updates, hopefully this does not fill up the 
space again.

wiki.outages.org is currently down as / partition was used up to 100%
causing apache and mysql to choke.

However we may know what may have caused it and in order to address this
issue we attempted to re-size / partition but we were unable to make the
VMware see the new size as the dynamic resizing is not supported at the
moment.

Having said that, we have since created a new VM and looking at
migrating data over including DNS change. Until this migration takes
place, wiki.outages.org will be unaccessible.

I apologize for any inconvenience.

Subject: [outages] Charter Peering issues??(At least ICMP)
Message-ID: <CAPC+kK7cuHStjig8xqt2KdQ9p-Y1u5cs0Mfqfb1Bc67T_ZzZSA@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone else having any issues reaching IP's on Charter communications? We
have 3 sites down from our monitoring tool(peered via Level 3) and trace
routes from level3's looking glass fail. Their looking glass also shows no
routers to the /4 that our IP is part of. I've noticed issues from
Centurylink's Looking glass as well on certain POP's and from Cogent as
well.

Traceroutes: I had to remove our office IP's for privacy but I think it
gets the point across that we can't reach both ways. Oddly enough SSH seems
to work sometimes so I wonder if its mostly an ICMP issue with occasional
drops of other traffic.

Office is in Ohio, IP/other route is in Tennessee but we also have it down
in South and North Carolina.

We contacted our next hop provider and they said that it was an issue with Telia and  that they could not open a ticket with them. I went onto a  Telia looking glass server in Charlotte, NC and conducted this trace:

We are going to get with the customer to see if he can get us some trace routes coming from Charter to see what that looks like.

I will keep you posted.

Lots of packetloss to their servers and most, if not all calls fail. Just 
got off the phone with them - they are aware and working on the problem they 
say. They have not created a master ticket created as of yet.

Update from bandwidth.com on our ticket and this issue:

=====================================================================================
*Jan 18 11:15 am (EST):*

Hi Chris,

We are reviewing our network. Assigning ticket to our Tier2 Team for 
assistance and they will keep you updated as information becomes available.


*Jan 18 11:18 am (EST):*

We have confirmed with engineering that they are currently reviewing the 
network. I have no additional details at this time, however updates will be 
provided as they become available.


*Jan 18 11:31 am (EST):*

Good Day,

Our engineering group has confirmed that service has been retored to the 
network and calls are normalizing.

We are continuing to monitor progress, and will continue to provide updates 
as they become available.

=====================================================================================


Our calls now seem to all be completing, but still seeing some packetloss 
and some of the audio is a bit choppy. Better, but service not fully 
restored at this point.


Chris

Subject: [outages] Bay Area packet loss at Comcast (gblx.net, he.net)
Message-ID: <CAPKkNb5guy_vkWtG52UxSC4-ukLUOkJ-BOHBaK=C3bbQvpox8A@mail.gmail.com>

I think this happens practically every evening recently, for traffic
between Comcast in NorCal and Linode at he.net in Fremont, around
gblx.net.

Today I have been monitoring through a crontab script since 16:00 PT,
with a 10-minute mtr runs in a loop.  The traffic loss has started in
the 20:50/21:00 timeframe, and is still ongoing (22:20).  There
weren't a 10-minute interval between 20:50 and 22:20 without at least
a 4% packet loss (often more than that).

Anyone else has noticed?  ssh is completely unusable for a couple of
seconds every now and again.

It seems to have subdued back to a 0% loss as of 22:20/22:30 window,
but I bet it'll be back.

Thats not an outage, thats a congested link - probably you should report to
HE / GBLX / Comcast....

It's been a 61% packet loss in the last minute...  Ridiculous.

Anyone from he.net / gblx.net / comcast.net to comment?

I'm not on the Comcast backbone team, but for what it's worth I just ran
MTR to 96.120.14.165 and to router1-fmt.linode.com for quite a while and
never lost a single packet from my desktop inside Comcast. I don't think
I'm hitting the problematic node, though. If I'm reading the results above
correctly, in all cases the problem begins when traffic hits
po4-20G.ar2.SJC2.gblx.net.

Am I misreading that?

Regards,
John

All
currently seeing a big outage down at MT datacentre1 in Sydney. Master
ticket 604473.

Seems to be a SAN fabric or switch issue that's affecting lots of customers
(again).

1. Usually Level 3-owned routers use ICMP prioritisation; routing
(forwarding) has priority over this.

2. Many traceroute implementations use UDP for their probe packets (in
attempt to solicit ICMP TTL exceeded messages to learn the network
topology); please make sure you're using pure ICMP all the way through
if possible.

3. Your below traces indicate a destination IP of 64.208.27.65, which is
not sufficient (ICMP prioritisation will be used to explain what you're
seeing, even if there is a real issue).  Please pick a destination IP of
an actual host that's somewhere behind that router which will respond to
ICMP packets reliably.

You need to see if the packet loss "trickles downward" past that hop to
every subsequent hop after that point (including the destination host),
or if high latency, if the latency "trickles downward" as well.

Here's an example of a bogus claim as a result of ICMP prio:

I also have no issue reaching their Dallas SBC via MPLS, or getting Internet connectivity though their circuit.  
What network are you calling their TFN from? Can we see mtr and traceroutes to xo.com?

All I got from Level3 was that the problem went away before it could be 
isolated.

Message-ID: <510029CE.9020204@axint.net>

Have a customer that does a lot of email to Korea and saw their mail backing 
up this morning due to 'host not found' errors to a domain they email 
frequently. Figured they let their domain expire, but in checking it out, I 
find I cannot query the name servers for their domain, which are 
ns[1234].whoisdomain.kr. Traffic to them dies on Level3 in LA:

For me, from Road Runner Tampa Bay, I can't even resolve the name of the
name server; mtr to the IP (211.206.125.155) dies hard and reliably at

ae-3-80.edge2.losangeles9.level3.net

, 12 hops from here.  The path to that point seems relatively clean.

Thanks - would seem from this and other posts, that they are not reachable 
from anywhere through anyone. Sounds like a major outage on their end, or 
with someone big between them and everyone else.

Anyone seeing issues between Charter and Cogent in the Chicago area? I've narrowed a severe packet loss issue down to a  handoff there using multiple route servers and looking glasses.

Different route than others but same results, though I think this is dying at the HE.net to Level3 connection in LA.

I know we're experiencing major Charter issues in Northern Wisconsin.  I
don't have any specific ticket numbers to reference, but we're seeing
clients in northern and central Wisconsin have rolling outages.

Still wish @Charter existed for their tech support on Twitter...

According to http://host.robtex.com/ns1.whoisdomain.kr.html#shared, 98
domains use ns1.whoisdomain.kr.  For ns2, ns3, and ns4, they all host 100
domains, each (likely the same ones).

Thanks - would seem from this and other posts, that they are not reachable
from anywhere through anyone. Sounds like a major outage on their end, or
with someone big between them and everyone else.

We are seeing similar issues in the Madison WI area with regards to Charter

How is this a "global outage"?  From my perspective you should be asking
your Thai ISP why they don't have peering with other providers for
redundancy (or if they do, why they haven't properly configured route
failover, or even manually reconfigured to use an alternate peer).

Seeing connectivity issues as traffic passes through Level 3 in Dallas -
not seeing the same issues for where routes converge (above.net in DFW)
over our TW Telecom link.

Anybody else experiencing this as well?

Please see my below post on this matter, which I posted only 2 days ago:

https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2013-January/005111.html

What you've shown in your mtr does not show any issue of any kind with
Level 3.  The packet loss shown at hops 4/5/6 does not "trickle down"
each subsequent hop (look at hop 7 onward for proof), nor is there any
sign of latency increase either.

On the other hand, the 2nd mtr you provided shows some degree of packet
loss starting at hop 2 (TW Telecom) which *does* "trickle down" through
all subsequent hops (egress).  If you want to know how many packets were
lost, look at the --order flag to mtr (I recommend --order=LSRNABW).

Plain and simple: talk to TW Telecom about the loss in their network.

Thanks, I am aware of what the traceroute shows and how a traceroute works.
The intent of the traceroute was primarily to show where I see our paths
between Level 3 and TW Telecom converge.

Plain and simple - we are experiencing connectivity issues over our Level 3
connection, which we're not seeing over our TW Telecom connection for
traffic destined to the same location.

Chris, is there some reason you're not providing actual
source/destination IPs for each of your mtrs?

The reason I'm asking is because I was left to believe what you were
providing was both ends of an asymmetric connection (i.e. mtr #1 was
for x.x.x.x to y.y.y.y, mtr #2 was for y.y.y.y to x.x.x.x).

However, your 2nd paragraph below ("we're seeing issues over one
connections but not another") seems to indicate what you provided are
two mtrs across completely different circuits.

So which is it?

Ah, my apologies on the confusion. They're two distinct paths out, not
traceroutes from each end.

I chose not to include the destination IP because the issues we're seeing a
more wide spread than to a single IP.

Level 3 managed to get back to us - they were originally reporting back to
us that they are experiencing connectivity issues for some of their clients
in Austin, which they're now denying and still continuing to investigate.

It looks like the situation has resolved itself in the last minute - I'm
still waiting for an update from Level 3, but from 2 off-list replies it
looks like there were a few people who've experienced routing issues with
Level 3 in Houston today.

Gotcha, now we're on the same page!  :-)

So can you provide return-path mtr or traceroutes that are associated
with both of your below links?  Level 3 will probably want this as well,
as most routing today is asymmetrical.

Rephrased verbosely: we need to see a total of 4 mtrs/traceroutes:

1) From x.x.x.x to y.y.y.y (your Level 3 link) -- you provided this
2) From y.y.y.y to x.x.x.x -- need this
3) From a.a.a.a to b.b.b.b (your TW Telecom link) -- you provided this
4) From b.b.b.b to a.a.a.a -- need this

What you showed in Item #1 (your L3 link) shows no actual/real issue.

What you showed in Item #3 (your TW Telecom link) **does** show packet
loss, but I cannot tell (without Item #4) if it's on the return-path or
the forward-path.  I understand "your TW Telecom link is working fine"
but the 0.1-0.2% packet loss indicates it may not be as good as you
think.  That may be a separate issue however, or may be by design
(QoS-like rules applied on router, etc.).

Make sense?  :-)

Subject: [outages] Omaha subterranean explosion and fire causing circuit issues
Message-ID: <00ce01cdfd10$619b3c80$24d1b580$@iname.com>

http://www.omaha.com/article/20130127/NEWS/130129676

I've seen several hi-cap circuits belonging to one customer in the Omaha
area bounce in and out since the explosion was first heard at 5:45 pm
Central.  A network partner, with a much larger circuit inventory, told a
colleague of mine that they were seeing some circuits in the Omaha area also
doing the same.  

At this time I am assuming that some of the transport gear is losing power
from time to time, or when the circuit is protection switching it's not
working like it's supposed to.

I'm not aware if anyone in the Farnam Building, which appears to be outside
the area affected by power problems, has had issues.

Fine for me from both wired and AT&T smartphone access, https in both
cases.  Perhaps localized problem for those seeing something weird?

I monitor a couple of their IPv6 addresses and
2a03:2880:10:8f01:face:b00c:0:25 and 2a03:2880:10:8f02:face:b00c:0:25 had
HTTP issues at 5:03 pm Central and also had a blip at 4:04 pm Central, and
the hosts 2a03:2880:2110:3f01:face:b00c::, 2a03:2880:10:8f01:face:b00c:0:25,
and 2a03:2880:10:8f02:face:b00c:0:25 have been down since about 6:56 pm
Central.

 

But the AAAA in my local cache for www.facebook.com
<http://www.facebook.com>  resolves to 2a03:2880:2050:1f01:face:b00c:0:9,
and so things work for me.   The joys of GLBDNS (or whatever facebook uses).

Appears to be inside of fb's network - prn1 = Prineville and San Francisco =
frc1.   Here's some non-working traces:

I monitor a couple of their IPv6 addresses and
2a03:2880:10:8f01:face:b00c:0:25 and 2a03:2880:10:8f02:face:b00c:0:25 had
HTTP issues at 5:03 pm Central and also had a blip at 4:04 pm Central, and
the hosts 2a03:2880:2110:3f01:face:b00c::, 2a03:2880:10:8f01:face:b00c:0:25,
and 2a03:2880:10:8f02:face:b00c:0:25 have been down since about 6:56 pm
Central.

 

But the AAAA in my local cache for www.facebook.com
<http://www.facebook.com>  resolves to 2a03:2880:2050:1f01:face:b00c:0:9,
and so things work for me.   The joys of GLBDNS (or whatever facebook uses).

facebook.com also resolves to 173.252.100.16 for me, and goes through San
Francisco as well:

I suspect that normally facebook.com responds on port 80.

Yep, thats weird. Can confirm facebook.com is down, but www.facebook.com is
up. Possibly a problem with their LB since the root would have to be
staticly set to an ip.

facebook.com resolves to 173.252.100.16 for me in australia.

To me that looks like the forward path is:

 3. Comcast: Santa Clara, CA
 4. Comcast: San Francisco, CA (always been an assumption on my part)
 5. Comcast: San Jose
 6. Comcast: Los Angeles
 7. Comcast: Los Angeles (One Wilshire)
 8. Comcast: possible FB<->Comcast peering point
 9. Facebook: Los Angeles
10. Facebook: Atlanta (note 60ms+ latency jump for cross-country)
11. Facebook: ???
11. Facebook: ???

If it went from LAX->ATL->SFO, I would expect to see the latency jump
~60-80ms at #9/#10, and then again at #10/#11.  But again, this is the
forward-path only.  And I refuse to believe FRC means Franca Airport in
Brazil.  ;-)

My previously posted IPv4 and IPv6 traceroutes show a 4 msec incremental hop
between atl1 and frc1, too.  If the host names are I accurate, I admit, too,
that I don't understand how one can get between Atlanta and San Francisco in
~4 msec.

My daily IPv6 tcptraceroute6 snapshot shows that I normally get to
2a03:2880:2110:3f01:face:b00c:: via that ATL hop, but Chicago to Atlanta
taking almost 30 msec?  More likely some asymmetric routing going on here.

To me that looks like the forward path is:

 1. LAN
 2. Comcast: Mountain View, CA
 3. Comcast: Santa Clara, CA
 4. Comcast: San Francisco, CA (always been an assumption on my part)
 5. Comcast: San Jose
 6. Comcast: Los Angeles
 7. Comcast: Los Angeles (One Wilshire)
 8. Comcast: possible FB<->Comcast peering point
 9. Facebook: Los Angeles
10. Facebook: Atlanta (note 60ms+ latency jump for cross-country)
11. Facebook: ???
11. Facebook: ???

If it went from LAX->ATL->SFO, I would expect to see the latency jump
~60-80ms at #9/#10, and then again at #10/#11.  But again, this is the
forward-path only.  And I refuse to believe FRC means Franca Airport in
Brazil.  ;-)

Was seeing the same from Chicago and L.A., although within just the last few
minutes I've started seeing this:

-----

If I navigate to http://facebook.com/ in the browser, I end up at

Port 80 on facebook.com is now working for me, redirecting to
www.facebook.com as is normal operation. Looks like they have updated their
DNS zone as i now get the following response (before i only got a single

facebook.com.           120     IN      SOA     a.ns.facebook.com.  dns.facebook.com. 2013012802 7200 1800 604800 120

Note the serial number is now at 2013012802 -- i.e. either the 2nd or
3rd revision (depending on if they start at 00 or 01) for today (Pacific
Time).

I don't have a SOA from when things weren't working (I don't use FB).

I saw the same thing here after flushing one DNS server's facebook.com
entry.   I've now flushed that entry on all our caching DNS resolvers so
that our end users will get the new info (caveat: local and application DNS
caching).

 

Anyone have a historical list of facebook.com's A records to see if it's
always been just 173.252.100.16?

Port 80 on facebook.com <http://facebook.com>  is now working for me,
redirecting to www.facebook.com <http://www.facebook.com>  as is normal
operation. Looks like they have updated their DNS zone as i now get the
following response (before i only got a single IPv4 address)

I saw the same thing here after flushing one DNS server's facebook.com entry.   I've now flushed that entry on all our caching DNS resolvers so that our end users will get the new info (caveat: local and application DNS caching).

Anyone have a historical list of facebook.com's A records to see if it's always been just 173.252.100.16?

This was received by one of my techs from DIDWW.
Currently DIDWW has been undergoing a service disruption on
all Mexico, Tijuana numbers. The cause of the present situation
was an unexpected act of vandalism. Therefore, it has been
taking a while for the services to be fully restored.
For the moment, we have been informed that the damaged
equipment is being replaced and the interconnection will be
restored in the course of the two upcoming days.

I don't have a lot of info at this time, but I wonder if anyone else
is seeing issues with XO. Both IP and SIP services seem to be
struggling.

I'll update with info as soon as I can get to my VPN or I hear back
from them (they've confirmed issues but don't have details yet).

Sorry the details were so sparse this morning. I wasn't in a position
to gather much info. Anyway, someone in our offices reports this from
XO:

"""
"Cisco Node" fail this morning. When it was brought back up, the
"software corrupted" and so they ordered a replacement that will be in
at 10:30pm tonight. Until then, quality will be bad...
"""

We're working out of XO's SLC office. That's all I've got for you :/


Best,
Gabe

Anyone else observing the same error :

Additionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to use an

Hi Folks,

I'm hearing reports of www.amazon.com being down, can't reach it myself, and http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.amazon.com shows it down.  Anyone have any info?

Going straight to www.amazon.com fails for me from Nebraska. 
  However, if you're able to bypass the home page, it seems 
to be working.  I was able to hit 
www.amazon.com/ref=gno_logo and some previous links.

Gizmodo is reporting odd functionality - direct product links work, and AWS appears unaffected. Twitter is ablaze with "amazon down" messages.

It's only the root page.  Go to any product page or other URL and it's fine:
http://www.amazon.com/mp3 for example.

Worked for me when www.amazon.com resolved to 205.251.242.54 and
72.21.194.212.  With companies that have such a large Internet presence
that's it's not enough to say anymore the "site" is down on port 80
(geographically hosted and potentially anycasted) or 53 (potentially
anycasted), one really needs the IP address that was resolved and a
traceroute to it so one can see the path.

Interesting -

   - http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/amazon.com shows Amazon as being
   down, but I can get to www.amazon.com and drill around in the site just
   fine.

getting to Amazon, did have some brief problems earlier in the day when 
others reported problems.

I was first alerted by our email server because there was no DNS resolution
for mchsi.com.

Every indication from my testing is that Mediacom's two DNS servers:
	NS1.MCOMDC.COM 74.84.103.134 
	NS2.MCOMDC.COM 74.84.119.134
are down.

I can't query anything about mchsi.com or mediacomcable.com, but
www.mediacomcc.com, which uses different nameservers, resolved just fine.

I was first alerted by our email server because there was no DNS resolution
for mchsi.com.

Every indication from my testing is that Mediacom's two DNS servers:
	NS1.MCOMDC.COM 74.84.103.134 
	NS2.MCOMDC.COM 74.84.119.134
are down.

I can't query anything about mchsi.com or mediacomcable.com, but
www.mediacomcc.com, which uses different nameservers, resolved just fine.

Frank

Seems like NS2 is down.

root at hellhound:~# dig +short MX mchsi.com @ns1.mcomdc.com
10 smtp.mchsi.com.

root at hellhound:~# dig +short MX mchsi.com @ns2.mcomdc.com
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

Additionally, NS1 is responding to ICMP pings while NS2 isn't.

For me, neither ns[12].mcomdc.com responds to ICMP or DNS queries.

I'm now seeing email for mediacombb.net backing up, too, as they use the
same DNS servers.

According to robtex (http://host.robtex.com/ns2.mcomdc.com.html#shared),
some other domains affected are gronkulator.com and inland.net.

Our backed up emails are clearing and both of Mediacom's DNS servers resolve
and all their websites load.  I'm going to assume that they've resolved the
issue.
