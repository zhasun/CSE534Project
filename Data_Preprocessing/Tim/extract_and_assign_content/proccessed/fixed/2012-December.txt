This statement is ridiculous. Sorry, I had to drop this comment.. the
middle east is a vast region and there are many cross border links,
comparable to the west. There are reasons why Turkey is prominent due to
geography and the sophistication of operators like Turk Telecom but its not
"the only decent transit pop" (also when did a country count as being a
"pop")

Syria is somewhat more fragile being under UN embargos but it still has
cross border links to the south as well. Not sure who "the rest of them"
are - all the countries in the region? Bizarre idea.

Regression Planning: There is a possibility that something unexpected 
may occur during the work process. Should any issues arise, all 
equipment will be placed back into standard operation and the work will 
be postponed until the issue is resolved.

There's a DS3 down in Miami which is causing a few headaches for people.

It was reported down this morning at around 11:38AM EST.

About 10 minutes ago we stopped being able to pass traffic through cogent. I de-peered us from Cogent, and everything appears
better. When I call cogent, all I get is a busy signal (must be a major outage). Anyone else seeing anything?

I saw packet loss to a destination in Troy, NY which has Cogent as one of its upstreams as well (and it was the Cogent path which I saw packet loss/disruption on).  This was observed from a non-Cogent multihomed network in Reston, VA.  Started at at 11:54 Eastern and ended about 20 minutes later.

Our L2 stuff in Atlanta and Dallas looks fine, but we don't have any L3
service from them. I also get a busy signal if I call their 877-7cogent
number or their local DC number.

About 10 minutes ago we stopped being able to pass traffic through cogent. I
de-peered us from Cogent, and everything appears
better. When I call cogent, all I get is a busy signal (must be a major
outage). Anyone else seeing anything?

Our gear in their Chicago POP is available, but I'm getting a busy signal
as well when calling in.

We had problems reaching addresses while going through
te0-1-0-5.ccr22.atl01.atlas.cogentco.com about 10-20 minutes ago.
I had a traceroute but I closed it :-) This is all the information I have today.
It could have been congestion related (one of my network engineers
explained this to me ;) rather than an equipment issue.

The issue for us seems to have resolved itself and everything is back to normal.

I wish people would learn to build BGP networks that die properly - as
in "if you can't forward my packets, don't claim you do".

Damn MPLS+RR text book setups, plus lack of proper monitoring.

About 10 minutes ago we stopped being able to pass traffic through cogent. I
de-peered us from Cogent, and everything appears
better. When I call cogent, all I get is a busy signal (must be a major
outage). Anyone else seeing anything?

Since this list is archived and googleable, I'd like for some accuracy and follow up here. So, this is really for memorialization purposes only.

The outage was related to an bad Ethernet cable between the telephone company and our gear in a remote central office of CenturyTel, in Newton, NJ. It affected a small number of DSL and T1 customers. The outage was not ours, but the phone company, and most importantly did not impact any datacenter or hosting clients whatsoever.

We have successfully upgraded to 2.6.1.

Major high-level fixes:
---------------------
- Security updates
- UTF8 fixes
- Fix PHP errors when signing up for mobile alerts
- KML overlay
- Faster (graph) rendering

I want to personally thank Ushahidi development community for giving me 
a hand specially Ajay who can code w/ his eyes shut, amazes me every 
single time.

Since KML overlay has been fixed with 2.6 release, tracker now 
plots/tracks crisis landing spots (thanks google!), check it out its 
pretty cool.

Hope you like it. Feedback is welcome!

Steps for this upgrade:

equipment will be placed back into standard operation and the work will
be postponed until the issue is resolved.

Seems to be working for me via Century Link and Level 3 communications now

Here is what I found for the outage

http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/10/gmail-experiences-a-widespread-outage-most-users-affected/



According to many reports on Twitter and our own testings, Gmail appears to be down for many users. Many writers are experiencing the outage, but it is not a total outage.

Mobile apps and IMAP through a regular mail client don?t work either. For now, users can try alternative methods, such as the basic HTML version, the mobile version, etc. There is no guarantee of success.

Some users report that their Chrome browser is crashing when they load gmail.com. Similarly, Google Drive and Google Calendar appear to be down for some users. There may be an authentification bug affecting Chrome Sync and Google?s authentification system. You can disable Chrome Sync and your browser won?t crash. It confirms that it comes from the authentification part.

Google didn?t update the status page for now. We?ve reached out to Google for a statement and will update as we learn more.

Update: Some users report that they can now load the Gmail web interface again.


Regards,
Steve

502. That?s an error.

The server encountered a temporary error and could not complete your request.

Please try again in 30 seconds. That?s all we know.

502. That's an error.

The server encountered a temporary error and could not complete your

haven't tried to nail it down (been nailing other coffins) but we 
definitely saw facebook related issues over the past hour.  dev teams were 
crying about facebook timeouts and delays as well.

Facebook.com is not resolving from quite a few DNS servers. On Verizon FiOS here, and it is failing. Google's DNS seems to resolve it fine, and my Verizon wireless phone seems to have no trouble accessing it via the app or the mobile web page. There are quite a number of folks on Twitter noting that Facebook is unreachable for them as well.

Facebook.com<http://Facebook.com> is not resolving from quite a few DNS servers. On Verizon FiOS here, and it is failing. Google's DNS seems to resolve it fine, and my Verizon wireless phone seems to have no trouble accessing it via the app or the mobile web page. There are quite a number of folks on Twitter noting that Facebook is unreachable for them as well.

The Google outage this morning and the Facebook outage this afternoon are
unrelated.

I could have provided dig +trace output but this is shorter and reads
easier.

It looks like records get looked up as follows (and I'm excluding the
root server lookups, i.e. . --> .com --> facebook.com):

facebook.com.           147814  IN      NS      b.ns.facebook.com.
facebook.com.           147814  IN      NS      a.ns.facebook.com.

And the A records:

a.ns.facebook.com.      172573  IN      A       69.171.239.12
b.ns.facebook.com.      172573  IN      A       69.171.255.12

The SOA for facebook.com (domain itself) hasn't been changed since
2012/12/07 (if SOA serial is truly kept in lines with the YYYYMMDD
model).

69.171.239.12 when queried for any records for www.facebook.com
results in a CNAME response to star.facebook.com.  It's probably named
"star" to indicate asterisk (*):

www.facebook.com.       338     IN      CNAME   star.facebook.com.
star.facebook.com.      1238    IN      NS      glb2.facebook.com.
star.facebook.com.      1238    IN      NS      glb1.facebook.com.

And the A records:

glb1.facebook.com.      3038    IN      A       69.171.239.10
glb2.facebook.com.      3038    IN      A       69.171.255.10

glb obviously stands for "global load balancer", though I have no idea
what device they use (F5s, Citrix Netscalers, Alteons (god forbid), or
something home-grown).

Given the below analysis from Terry, it looks to me like:

a) one or both of their load balancers may have been overloaded briefly
   and did not respond to DNS queries (or possibly something at layer 2
   or layer 3 was affecting this)
b) one or more of the nameservers *behind* glb[12].facebook.com were
   overloaded or broken in some way, or layer 2/3 was responsible for
   breakage (between glbs and nameservers)

The only people who know for certain are -- yup -- the Facebook folks.

And naturally this is me doing my testing from a single source, so its
possible they use anycast to distribute some of their load, in which
case the above analysis (despite speculative) is still correct, except
what actual devices/networks are involved would be different.

You're welcome.  :-)

Yeah, I think my result was a red herring. a.ns.facebook.com and b.ns.facebook.com still can't resolve the A record for star.facebook.com, despite things seemingly being back to normal now. The NS record is what's key and by the time I looked at it, it was fixed.

Why some people feel the need to get so clever with DNS is beyond me. How about just resolving the A records directly from the facebook.com NS servers, instead of via a CNAME to another group of DNS servers? Would that be so difficult? Then you're shocked when there's an outage.

root server lookups, i.e. . --> .com --> facebook.com):

facebook.com.? ? ? ? ?  147814? IN? ? ? NS? ? ? b.ns.facebook.com.
facebook.com.? ? ? ? ?  147814? IN? ? ? NS? ? ? a.ns.facebook.com.

And the A records:

a.ns.facebook.com.? ? ? 172573? IN? ? ? A? ? ?  69.171.239.12
b.ns.facebook.com.? ? ? 172573? IN? ? ? A? ? ?  69.171.255.12

The SOA for facebook.com (domain itself) hasn't been changed since
2012/12/07 (if SOA serial is truly kept in lines with the YYYYMMDD
model).

69.171.239.12 when queried for any records for www.facebook.com
results in a CNAME response to star.facebook.com.? It's probably named
"star" to indicate asterisk (*):

www.facebook.com.? ? ?  338? ?  IN? ? ? CNAME?  star.facebook.com.
star.facebook.com.? ? ? 1238? ? IN? ? ? NS? ? ? glb2.facebook.com.
star.facebook.com.? ? ? 1238? ? IN? ? ? NS? ? ? glb1.facebook.com.

And the A records:

glb1.facebook.com.? ? ? 3038? ? IN? ? ? A? ? ?  69.171.239.10
glb2.facebook.com.? ? ? 3038? ? IN? ? ? A? ? ?  69.171.255.10

glb obviously stands for "global load balancer", though I have no idea
what device they use (F5s, Citrix Netscalers, Alteons (god forbid), or
something home-grown).

Given the below analysis from Terry, it looks to me like:

a) one or both of their load balancers may have been overloaded briefly
?  and did not respond to DNS queries (or possibly something at layer 2
?  or layer 3 was affecting this)
b) one or more of the nameservers *behind* glb[12].facebook.com were
?  overloaded or broken in some way, or layer 2/3 was responsible for
?  breakage (between glbs and nameservers)

The only people who know for certain are -- yup -- the Facebook folks.

And naturally this is me doing my testing from a single source, so its
possible they use anycast to distribute some of their load, in which
case the above analysis (despite speculative) is still correct, except
what actual devices/networks are involved would be different.

You're welcome.? :-)

There *is* no A record for star.facebook.com -- there's only a CNAME,
which in turn induces per-record NS lookups.  So this is normal.

As for your 2nd question -- this opens a very large Pandora's box when
it comes to DNS engineering and operational deployments.  I can think of
quite a few reasons there should be separate load balancers for the
"main" facebook.com domain and ns.facebook.com bits, and the actual LBs
which return A records for the webservers that return web content.
Effectively what you're proposing is just to have lots of LBs handling
the DNS queries for everything, rather than segregate/delineate things
a bit more.  I can assure you there are justifications for this, but
since I don't work at Facebook, I can't provide those.

What I've seen today is not that complex of a setup, though depending on
what LBs they use, I might not particularly enjoy looking at those
configurations.  But what's shown here, at least if using a Citrix
NetScaler, isn't that complex.

All that said -- it is absolutely possible for them to remove use of the
star.facebook.com CNAME and just have a series of LBs respond with
appropriate A records when faced with a www.facebook.com A record query.

However, given that there's quite a lot of crapola-nonsense that falls
under the facebook.com domain (I'm talking about the equivalent of a
content delivery network, their image hosting stuff, and God knows what
else today -- I haven't used Facebook since January 2011), due to "Web
2.0" nutballs always wanting to make a mess of things ( ;-) ), I'm not
too surprised by the above.

We have been noticing connectivity issues through AboveNet/Zayo/AS6461 out
of San Jose, CA.  Some networks are reachable while others are not. Among
those that are not are at least some Google netblocks.

Is anyone else seeing this issue?  We have a ticket open with Zayo, but
have not received a callback.

Thanks!

Has anyone else been having issues w/Windstream today?  Our MPLS services in WI and IL are find, but we can't make any outbound calls, though inbound is working.  If you call their NOC you just get the option to leave a voicemail because call volume is so high.

Anyone else experiencing issues?

Starting at 8am Central Time, we're seeing issues with Level3 in Chicago. I
don't have access to the far end to do a traceroute from the far side.

Traceroute with our Level3 peering up:

We've opened a ticket with Level3, just wondering if anyone else has

Not sure what your issue is. I'm in Ohio so from here I don't hit chicago
but I did traceroutes from Level3's looking glass in both Chicago and St.
Louis(since it looks likes thats where you are coming from:

Chicago makes it to the last hop before the last host, not sure if the last
host blocks it:

I just heard back from Level3 confirming that there is an issue affecting
multiple customers being investigated, although I don't have any details.
My last test showed that it would work if I turned it back up, but it would
route from STL to Denver and then to CHI:

Has anyone else been having issues w/Windstream today?  Our MPLS services in WI and IL are find, but we can't make any outbound calls, though inbound is working.  If you call their NOC you just get the option to leave a voicemail because call volume is so high.

Anyone else experiencing issues?

We have several legacy Uslec/Paetec customers affected in Florida, we have been unable to find out what is wrong but we were given Master Ticket #1213-178.
If anyone hears anything about cause and ETR please post here, I will do the same.

Starting at 8am Central Time, we're seeing issues with Level3 in Chicago. I don't have access to the far end to do a traceroute from the far side.

Traceroute with our Level3 peering up:

Has anyone else been having issues w/Windstream today?  Our MPLS services in WI and IL are find, but we can?t make any outbound calls, though inbound is working.  If you call their NOC you just get the option to leave a voicemail because call volume is so high.

Anyone else experiencing issues?

Message-ID: <57D26724E9C60A42B1137169CEBB357C0388FBF0@pg-ex01.pg.local>

-- Anyone from Level3 --



First - I realize ICMP testing is not and end all be all, but seeing packet loss as well between two different carriers.  Plan to potentially open tickets, but hoping for someone at Level3 to check a hop (below)?



Anyone seeing or having issues with anything handing off from Level3 to china, specifically china telecom?



Customer is dead in the water on a move, and at CHINA-TELEC.edge1.SanJose3.Level3.net [4.71.114.102] seeing some latency double or more from an ATT path that routes through Sprint.  Customer trying to move ipsec tunnel over (and change ISP's) and cannot due to double+ the latency routing over from Level3 vs. Sprint.



FYI - this issue has been the same for a week or more.  Dont have any specific times, but customer calling me during the day EST to look at this and it's been the same every day...



Two different traces below (I cut some out as the first hops are fine, it's the hand off)..



First, the "good":

I opened a ticket with Level 3 about 2 months ago on this same issue.  I think I also replied to another similar question on this list.

There is a very high level of utilization on this link. Level 3 is aware of the high utilization and has been for a while.

I used BGP knobs to route specific prefixes that were in China to a Sprint circuit and performance was far better.

Good luck.

We've been through this with Level3 as well. They point to China Telcom as
being the hold-up on increasing the capacity between the two.

Message-ID: <CAKnNFz-B-NX2u4zbd5fxnOZV_dcGjC5YQYzfnvAuXLX+kS+ZEA@mail.gmail.com>

Seeing massive packet loss and high latency from 360.net (which appears to
be owned by zayo/abovenet/whatever) in denver....

Here is a trace snip from our server @ softlayer in dallas to one of our
servers in denver

 5:  ae0.bbr01.cs01.lax01.networklayer.com (173.192.18.141)  29.698ms
 6:  no reply
 7:  66.62.2.213 (66.62.2.213)                            4588.320ms
 8:  den1-core-01-xe-1-1-0.360.net (66.62.2.166)          22583.831ms

I only have one one server in denver that I can reproduce this with hoping
someone can else can test and reproduce similar issues

thanks

Chris,

You need to provide traceroutes from both directions.  The below is for
Dallas --> Denver, but the return path (Denver --> Dallas) needs to be
provided too.  You might find that the return path goes through some
provider other than Zayo/360/Abovenet/whateverthey'recalledtoday.

I know that's hard to do when the path has latency or packet loss (which
you don't show in your results -- you only show latency), but this is
exactly what a cronjob traceroute writing to a log file is for.  :-)

My point: remember that routing on the Internet most of the time is
asymmetric.  Reference material (read, do not skim):

http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog47/presentations/Sunday/RAS_Traceroute_N47_Sun.pdf

Finally, you didn't provide IP addresses of either server (in Denver or
Dallas), so when you ask for "someone else to test", that's not easily
doable, at least not to the endpoints involved (pinging routers is not
sufficient evidence, sadly).

Ok sorry, the denver side for us is 208.89.160.11 and the dallas
softlayer side for us is 70.87.254.1

You are right about different paths it appears that the route back is
direct via level3 instead of 360/zayo and same latency is present so
looks like more likely a softlayer issue?

For Dallas->Denver, the latency begins between hop #7 (360.net in
LAX/Los Angeles) and hop #8 (360.net in DEN/Denver).  The latency
at hop #6 is probably the result of ICMP prioritisation (indicated by
lower latency at hop #7).

For Denver->Dallas, latency and packet loss begins between hop #4
(Level3 in Denver) and hop #5 (SoftLayer in Denver).

Thus, to solve this issue, you would need to have the following 3
providers all on the phone at the same time talking to one another
simultaneously, and give all 3 of them the below traceroutes/mtrs with
evidence (because they need to know what physical interfaces the packets
are flowing across):

- 360.net / Zayo / Abovenet
- Level3
- SoftLayer

The most you can do yourself is contact the providers who you have
service with (i.e. SoftLayer and GreenhouseData.net(?)) and ask if there
is anything they can do or contact their peering providers.  Contact
them and put pressure on them.

Because the issue is so far "in" (i.e. not at hop #2 or #3 within
traceroutes), there is very little you can do.  Even if you had peering
arrangements with, say, L3 and 360/Zayo/AboveNet, its not evident from
the traceroutes and you'll usually be ignored (or more specifically you
will be asked repeatedly "What's your customer ID?" and if you don't
have one, basically told to sod off).

Remember: the Internet is always broken, 24x7x365, in some regard.  It
sucks when your packets suffer from it, but there's very little you can
do when you don't have contractual arrangements with the providers who
are experiencing issues.

P.S. -- From my home Comcast connection in Mountain View, I see no
issues to either 208.89.160.11 nor 70.87.254.1 -- but my packets go
through completely different interfaces and/or routers than whats shown
in your traceroutes.  The same goes from tests performed from my VPS in
Los Angeles (who has peering with SoftLayer directly) -- again, packets
going through completely different interfaces.

Yeah I have a ticket open with softlayer as it seems they are the most
common factor and the only one i have a direct relationship in this
situation, no response so far in about an hour but hopefully before
the workforce starts ringing phones off the hook :)

Hi Chris,

Not entirely what we saw tonight, but we had issues reaching some places 
via a very similar path, and we peer with 360 and level3. I've 
localprefed around it for the time being, but only just saw this email.  
Can't confirm our issue was what you were seeing, but we were definitely 
seeing packet loss, latency, and what appeared to be occasional loops on 
networklayer.  Not particularly useful, I realise, but I guess count me 
in as a tentative "me too."

Hi Tim,

Just tracerouted your ip and saw a hop in the same location:

11. xe-0-0-1.mpr1.den1.above.net      0.0%    32   59.6  60.0  59.3  70.6   1.9
12. 208.185.20.58.t01657-09.above.ne  0.0%    32   59.7  60.3  59.4  76.0   2.9
13. den1-edge-01-lag2.360.net        46.9%    32   60.6  63.0  60.3  95.1   8.3
14. 66.62.160.42                      0.0%    32  200.1  79.1  65.9 200.1  37.1
15. static-65-19-63-33.cybermesa.com  0.0%    32  248.4  80.9  67.8 248.4  41.3

Hop 13 was one of the links we were hitting and seeing alot of latency
and loss, also noticed its acronym LAG maybe this was some kind of
weird LACP failure

Anyway after checking your side and seeing it was normal, I retested
and the issue appears to be resolved for me in both directions

So either someone on here silently bumped the issue and got it fixed
or softlayer was able to resolve this after my ticket

Either way, thanks!
chris

	No, everything good here in downtown. Watching FFL via RCN. Can you
post a traceroute?

My router's offline at the moment so I can't paste one; when I ran it
before it was dying just up from my router. Looks like our building is
down; was wondering if it was building, neighborhood, or city level.
>From others who kindly responded off list, it is clearly either
building or neighborhood level at this point.

We've been seeing intermittent TCP/UDP connectivity issues from Cox

traceroutes are fine, but DNS lookups time out for minutes at a time, then
work again for ~5 minutes before repeating the problem.  ICMP is never

Brandon,

Do you have return-path traceroutes from 198.46.80.1 to wherever you did
the below traceroute (and what is that source IP)?  Also, is 198.46.80.1
a host/system or a router?  If a router, please do not do that -- please
use a host/system as a destination.

I would say the problem looks like it's happening between hops #6 and #7
in the below traceroute (jump in latency from 5ms to 210ms), but that
may be normal -- do you have traceroutes for what things look like
normally?

The latency seen may also be caused by issues on the return-path.

P.S. -- This would be the first I've heard in a long time where ICMP
*was not* affected, but TCP and UDP were.  Usually the reports are
"everything is impacted" or "only ICMP is impacted" (result of ICMP
deprio and a reporter not having familiarity with that fact).

We have received a report of similar issues today. The client has servers with us in several locations where we use nLayer and/or PacketExchagne and his monitoring system is on a network that uses Cox as its preferred upstream. He shutdown his Cox upstream and didn?t have any issues reaching the servers over his backup provider. The issues were sporadic and did not affect all protocols ? ICMP pings worked, snmpwalk was fine, but UDP traces were dying somewhere on the reverse path. Seems to be very similar to what you are seeing.

Hi Jeremy, thanks for getting back to me.

That is indeed our edge router, I was just giving an example of the path.

We have all return traffic preferenced to leave the network via our Level3
connection right now, and we've got our AS prepended with our nLayer
session multiple times.  Cox is choosing to use our nLayer route inbound
regardless and we're not going to consider taking it down to resolve the
problem.

The trace path I sent is not unusual for our connection (though the latency
is, we've been in contact with Cox about that), I was providing it as an
example of the inbound path only.

The issue is affecting all Cox users in our area, so it's not isolated to
our office or even our city.

The fact that ICMP is unaffected leads me to believe that a malfunctioning
device performing some sort of "traffic shaping" may be at fault.

Something else that just clicked, I have been having a number of issues reaching arin.net today from one of my servers in Los Angeles that uses nLayer as its upstream. Request response times are between 20 and 40 seconds as opposed to 2 to 4 seconds on our office connection. Looking at my trace from LA, we are going LA<->Cox<->ARIN.

We have received a report of similar issues today. The client has servers with us in several locations where we use nLayer and/or PacketExchagne and his monitoring system is on a network that uses Cox as its preferred upstream. He shutdown his Cox upstream and didn?t have any issues reaching the servers over his backup provider. The issues were sporadic and did not affect all protocols ? ICMP pings worked, snmpwalk was fine, but UDP traces were dying somewhere on the reverse path. Seems to be very similar to what you are seeing.

We've been seeing intermittent TCP/UDP connectivity issues from Cox Communications in Virginia to any location that routes over nLayer.  UDP traceroutes are fine, but DNS lookups time out for minutes at a time, then work again for ~5 minutes before repeating the problem.  ICMP is never affected during the outages.

We have some customers in Wichita KS who are using Cox having issues connecting to our servers in San Jose CA. via Internap the tracert to us was timing out. They moved to their back up ISP and are ok for the moment. The issue seems more widespread then we initially believed

All,

I knew I should have checked this list before opening tickets far and
wide.  I've been experiencing this issue since before 5:30pm EST and just
wanted to report that ICMP *IS* affected for me, but only for certain IP
addresses.  TCP seems to be intermittently affected.

I host a server at InfoRelay with network 69.169.88.16/28.  From a Cox
Communications optical internet circuit I can ping 69.169.88.20 and .21,
but not .22 .23 or .24.

chantilly-asa# ping 69.169.88.20
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 69.169.88.20, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/2/10 ms

chantilly-asa# ping 69.169.88.21
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 69.169.88.21, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/2/10 ms

chantilly-asa# ping 69.169.88.22
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 69.169.88.22, timeout is 2 seconds:
?????
Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)

chantilly-asa# ping 69.169.88.23
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 69.169.88.23, timeout is 2 seconds:
?????
Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)

A good trace looks like this (first hop obscured):

  7     *        *        *     Request timed out.

Although TCP connections still work, they're highly intermittent.  I
haven't had a successful ICMP echo reply from 69.169.88.22 or 69.169.88.23
from a Cox connection via nLayer for several hours.

I'm asking both Cox and InfoRelay to depeer from nLayer.

Feel free to use my server as an ICMP target.

I'm showing that this issue cleared approximately 10 minutes ago.  From Cox
I can now ping and traceroute to any IP address via nLayer without
intermittency:

chantilly-asa# ping 69.169.88.22
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 69.169.88.22, timeout is 2 seconds:
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/2/10 ms

chantilly-asa# traceroute 69.169.88.22

Type escape sequence to abort.

 7  66.231.177.66 10 msec 0 msec 10 msec
 8  69.169.88.22 0 msec 0 msec 10 msec

Resolved from my end.  Resolved for everyone else?

Thanks!

Likewise, if folks need a west-coast destination to test ICMP against
(but not UDP or TCP), you can use mine: 206.125.172.42.  VPS provider
(arpnetworks) peers with Mzima, who peers with nLayer.

Earlier I was noticing that packets destined to 192.149.252.75 would
consistently (100% of the time) not solicit an ICMP time-exceeded
response from Cox's router (hop #7 below), but packets destined to
192.149.252.76 did solicit ICMP time-exceeded.

As of a few minutes ago, that behaviour has changed.  How things look
right now:

$ traceroute -n -P icmp 192.149.252.75
traceroute to 192.149.252.75 (192.149.252.75), 64 hops max, 72 byte packets

12  192.149.252.76  82.755 ms  73.740 ms  72.935 ms

How they looked before (for packets destined to 192.149.252.75), and
again, this was 100% reproducible (skipping right to TTL 6):

$ traceroute -n -f 6 -P icmp 192.149.252.75
traceroute to 192.149.252.75 (192.149.252.75), 64 hops max, 72 byte packets

 8  * * *
 9  * * *
10  98.172.152.14  78.109 ms  74.391 ms  81.120 ms
^C

I can only speculate at what transpired there (possibly some device with
a hashing algorithm for LB misbehaving?), and maybe that's related.
Unsure.

I can confirm that things are looking much better from here as well -- In total we had 2 client reports of related issues and 1 has confirmed that it has cleared, and  arin.net is loading at the same speed through nLayer<->Cox<->ARIN as it does on other connections to which I have access.

Likewise, if folks need a west-coast destination to test ICMP against (but not UDP or TCP), you can use mine: 206.125.172.42.  VPS provider
(arpnetworks) peers with Mzima, who peers with nLayer.

Earlier I was noticing that packets destined to 192.149.252.75 would consistently (100% of the time) not solicit an ICMP time-exceeded response from Cox's router (hop #7 below), but packets destined to
192.149.252.76 did solicit ICMP time-exceeded.

As of a few minutes ago, that behaviour has changed.  How things look right now:

$ traceroute -n -P icmp 192.149.252.75
traceroute to 192.149.252.75 (192.149.252.75), 64 hops max, 72 byte packets

$ traceroute -n -P icmp 192.149.252.76
traceroute to 192.149.252.76 (192.149.252.76), 64 hops max, 72 byte packets
 1  206.125.172.41  4.025 ms  20.726 ms  4.288 ms

12  192.149.252.76  82.755 ms  73.740 ms  72.935 ms

How they looked before (for packets destined to 192.149.252.75), and again, this was 100% reproducible (skipping right to TTL 6):

$ traceroute -n -f 6 -P icmp 192.149.252.75 traceroute to 192.149.252.75 (192.149.252.75), 64 hops max, 72 byte packets
 6  69.31.127.230  0.759 ms  0.785 ms  0.717 ms
 7  * * *
 8  * * *
 9  * * *
10  98.172.152.14  78.109 ms  74.391 ms  81.120 ms ^C

I can only speculate at what transpired there (possibly some device with a hashing algorithm for LB misbehaving?), and maybe that's related.
Unsure.

Subject: [outages] Possible Cogent > CFL Brighthouse Issue?
Message-ID: <1102d42e$366c6e4$6721a551$@flhsi.com>

For about the last week I've noticed remote desktop to my NOC workstation 
has just crawled.

Also noticed I could only pull ~1Mb/s from anything at the NOC.

Can anyone confirm what I'm seeing?

NOC=208.90.219.18
Home=50.89.171.242

Trace is asymmetric. Using BGP knobs to avoid AS7843>AS174(?) resolves the 
issue.

Other Possible Relevant data.
AS2828's route to AS33363 is Via AS7843. So they aren't announcing 
50.88.0.0/15 to AS2828 it seems.
Can't seem to get to AS3356's Looking glass, But I'm pretty sure AS33363 
prepends the hell out of it's routes sent to AS3356.

It's the holiday season again, that time of year when we find out which
mailing list participants' mailers ignore the dictum that you should never
send vacation-outage notifications in response to a mailing list message.

:-)

Happy Chriskwanzukkah, Merry Festivus and a Cool Yule to everyone on the list;
here's to an even lower traffic 2013.  Now that we know there's going to be
a 2013.

Cheers,

A manhole (#5341 - corner of Smithfield St. and Strawberry Way) fire in PIT has taken down ~30 AT&T DS3s. Unsure of any impact to other carriers, but it's assumed. As of 6:30AM EST, they estimate it will be 3-4 (9:30-10:30AM EST) hours before anyone can start repairs.

FYI!

Nothing on the neustar twitter as far as an outage, just a bunch of sales stuff.  https://twitter.com/ultradns.  Anyone have insight as to a reason for outage or ETA?

A manhole (#5341 - corner of Smithfield St. and Strawberry Way) fire in PIT has taken down ~30 AT&T DS3s. Unsure of any impact to other carriers, but it's assumed. As of 6:30AM EST, they estimate it will be 3-4 (9:30-10:30AM EST) hours before anyone can start repairs.

FYI!

I can confirm we saw a loss of service for some IPv4 domains hosted by UltraDNS from the UK between 0245UTC and 0345UTC.

The Dynect nameservers are a new addition -- as of 11pm EST last night Tumblr only had UltraDNS:

Last night:

    Record last updated on..: 2012-08-17.

    Domain servers in listed order:

    pdns3.ultradns.org
    pdns4.ultradns.org
    pdns2.ultradns.net
    pdns6.ultradns.co.uk
    pdns1.ultradns.net
    pdns5.ultradns.info

Today:

    Record last updated on..: 2012-12-26.

    Domain servers in listed order:

    ns1.p03.dynect.net
    pdns2.ultradns.net
    ns3.p03.dynect.net
    pdns4.ultradns.org
    pdns6.ultradns.co.uk
    pdns3.ultradns.org
    ns2.p03.dynect.net
    ns4.p03.dynect.net

Still has the mismatched serial issue, but I suspect they're just maintaining the zones separately, it's not like they would've been able to set up Dynect as secondaries while UltraDNS was having issues anyhow.

Maintaining zones separately is a reliability defense-in-depth technique anyways.

Of course, we can not be completely sure about other locations, but it is

Looks like it's back up.  I wasn't able to get to it previously, but now I
can get to the homepage as well as login to Internet banking.

Well sure, but even if you had two separate sets of DNS zone resolver servers,
which is what I think you actually mean, you would still *push them* from 
zones with the same SN, no?

No, I meant two totally separate chains.

Yes, you can screw things up by not keeping them in sync, but too many extended outages have happened because you screw up the one true hidden master, and then it breaks and you can't clean up the public facing slaves fast enough (TTL, timeouts, etc).

Defense in depth starts with "assume the worst single thing just happened for system X; now what?".  Having two separate independent X is a good start.

Certs are similar.  The truly paranoid should have 2-3 separate CA's certs available for the service.  The CA going south, insane, or having to revoke are all real risks.
