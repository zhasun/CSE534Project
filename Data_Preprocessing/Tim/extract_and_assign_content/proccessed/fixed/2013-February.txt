Hi,

Office365 via webmail (OWA) or Outlook seems to be down from Italy.

Someone with the same issue?

Office365 (Microsoft's hosted email, sharepoint, Lync, etc service) seems 
to be broken for new connections.. IE - users who had Outlook open or an 
established Lync connection before it bombed are still working fine, but 
people trying to connect are getting failures.

I am not sure, but it may be a DNS issue? IE - the server that my mailbox 
resides on (BY2PRD0712.mailbox.outlook.com) does not resolve.

Looks to be widespread:

We have a customer on that service and a co-worker found a status page (requires login, otherwise I'd ask him for the URL) indicating that the signon service is having issues.

As others have noted, O365 seems to be back to normal now. The status page 
at O365 (requires login as you said) still has not cleared though.

I'm getting reports from my techs that calls are not completing from Comcast to 734 numbers hosted with Bandwidth. Bandwidth is not seeing the calls make it to them. Does anyone know of any issues going on in that area?

Interesting timing.

A friend of mine who has her site hosted at a provider called "Just
Host" also just asked if I could reach her stuff (I can't).  Her IP is
within 173.254.0.0/17.

An mtr to her site:

Notice the common trend?

199.58.199.114 is part of 199.58.196.0/22 which is "Ace Data Centers".

Possibilities as I see them:

a) This "Ace Data Centers" co-location provider (in Provo, UT) is
experiencing network-level problems

b) There is a "common hosting provider" who uses "Ace Data Centers" who
is down hard and hasn't bothered to tell anyone what is going on.  If
that's the case, time to read your contract and see if there's an SLA.

TL;DR -- it's not you.

lmao, i'm on my way out with hostmonster anyways, its too pricy for the
little bit of hosting I do(2 sites) already moved one domain away from them
and got my self a 2GB VPS for $70/year vs. the ~$130/year host monster
wanted. plus I can do what ever I want on my VPS. just my 2 cents.

I was actually planning on doing some of the actual migration tonight(I'm
used to 3rd shift) i guess this thows a wrench in the works.

Hi Everyone,

 

Does anyone know anything about BlueHost being down?  I have a couple
websites hosted with them.

 

http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http://www.bluehost.com
<http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http:/www.bluehost.com> 

This shows it is down.

 

Thanks,

Anyone  having SIP call quality problems with Windstream? It seems to be from about 10AM CST to 2PM CST for the past 3 to 4 days.  They are claiming a congestion issue in the northeast.

That doesn't say a whole lot, most of the bigger sites are often firewalled off in terms of ICMP and the like. A dig trace works fine, and their nameservers are responding;

Message-ID: <51110AAE.4020900@uvm.edu>

Hello,

Since Sunday my ATT Microcell has been offline...   According to ATT CS 
they say that the all of the northeast Microcell system is offline.   
Something about a software upgrade to the Microcell's when banana's .

Has anyone in the northeast heard anything similar or know anything?

ATT Microcell's aggravate me. You would think they would want the world to install as many of these things they can, helping make their coverage ubiquitous. Instead, you have a unit which requires sky view (GPS), so that makes it damn near impossible to use in a basement (where many people don't have good cell coverage), and you have to pre-register the phones that will use it - with a limitation on it of how many phones are allowed to be pre-registered.

This goes along with a whole list of complaints I have about cell carriers, who seem to have stalled in technology acceptance. Why no cell-voice or SMS or MMS over WiFi? I know a carrier or two are doing this, but it is not widely deployed. If they are complaining so much about network and frequency congestion, it seems that this sort of offload would be something they want.

T-Mobile offers voice, SMS, and MMS over WiFi on most of its devices and
has for the last several years.  This feature alone is a great reason to
make a change and one reason I was so fearful of AT&T buying them up last
year.

Hi all,

I'm seeing an inability for at&t phone to receive text messages.
Sending to Verizon phones seems to work, but at&t to at&t, or Verizon
to at&t does not.

Twitter seems to have some chatter about this over the past 2hrs, so
I'm wondering if others are seeing this nationally.

Thanks,
Mike

a success.

I've just seen a reminder from Facebook that they'll be down for a backbone
upgrade on the 29th and 30th; I pass this along for those whose eyeball
customers will burn up your help lines about it.

Have a link to details on this?  Curious as to what aspects will be down, don't see anything useful on their platform status page.

Can you provide some more details? 

I can assure you that facebook has not scheduled 48 hours of downtime for its entire platform?

Isn't the point of this list to be low-traffic no-discussion reports/information-only?

It is, indeed.  Perhaps the list should set reply-to over to discuss?  This has benefits and drawbacks; I will discuss it with Vi and Frank.

It should be but it seems to have descended into website outage, dns blips
and localised cable provider reporting lately.

Perhaps time for a new list with less noise?

"The primary goal of this mailing list ("outages") is for outages-reporting
that would apply to failures of major communications infrastructure
components having significant traffic-carrying capacity, similar to what
FCC provided prior to 9/11 days but they seem to have pulled back due to
terrorism concerns. Some also believe that LEC's and IXC's also like this
model as they no longer have to air their dirty laundry. Then again, this
mailing list is not about making anyone look bad, its all about information
sharing and keeping network operators & end users abreast on the situation
as close to real-time information as possible in order to assess and
respond to major outage such as routing voice/data via different carriers
which may directly or indirectly impact us and our customers. A reliable
communications network is essential in times of crisis. "

Please don't.  On other lists where this is done it has actually added more
new problems.

I apologize for adding to the noise by responding to the comedy.

Or a stronger definition of "major?"  I recently started a discussion on a

Maybe someone can update the mailman page which defines the list's purpose
and perhaps step in with some occasional moderation? Who exactly are the
list owners (not the server, the list)..

Based on this: "failures of major communications infrastructure components
having significant traffic-carrying capacity"

I would say this is backbone fibre outages only, sea cable cuts, full
regional affecting issues etc.

Websites and DNS belongs to NANOG.. or downforeveryoneorjustme.com

Put another way, I can work out myself if there is a facebook or google
outage and dont need to compare reports from 100 areas of the world none of
which factor in the technology which distributed applications and sites use.

What I think the above defines is clear "cable X is cut on bridge Y between
cities A and B affecting providers L+M who both use this duct" type of
notifications - things that are precise and fundamental in their nature.

Exactly, and they will be continual and high volume in nature.. you will
only gain real value in knowing of large infrastructure problems which
affect many things simultaneously.

I'd agree.  The problem is, when it's YOUR connection that's down, it's major.  When it's someone you never speak to, it doesn't matter at all.  Between those two extremes, it's all "shades of gray."

I'd argue yes; the reason I cared a whit about Facebook isn't because I have end-users who use it, but that my employer offers OAuth via Facebook Connect.  When THAT goes down, it affects all manner of things.

Feel free to redirict to -discuss if this is more appropriate there.

I think making the definition of "major" more clear would be useful.  Despite Steve's comment about DNS, I think outages of 8.8.8.8 or OpenDNS count as major.  I think state-wide broadband outages also qualifies.

Perhaps put a number of users affected?  Perhaps add an exception for geographical areas, say a whole country or province/state?

Then when people email the list about a traceroute and having 20% packet loss on hop 5 out of 12 and nothing anything else, we can make fun of them.  You know, since that always works.

Oh, I almost forgot: Jay, you're ugly and your mother dresses you funny.  (That should stop him from off-topic posting. :)

Is this a serious answer? Because something is important to you it should
fall into the definition of  "failures of major communications
infrastructure components having significant traffic-carrying capacity" ?

.. thats precisely the definition of something thats a localised issue and
should not be shared outside that community. You need to subscribe to an
OAuth mailing list.

No, it qualifies given that almost every consumer (and a fair few business) facing service out there lets you use either Twitter or Facebook to authenticate; it's in the same bucket as 8.8.8.8 going down.  Widespread service failures for end users result if it happens, and is the kind of thing that's useful to understand in the context of "why is the helpdesk phone exploding."

Localized only insofar as it's a layer 7 problem should it hit; past that, the effects are internet-wide.

The problem here is that 8.8.8.8 as well as many large web sites are
distributed. Its legitimately down for you and not for 95% of the rest of
its users which may in turn be only a small % of the wider telecom/internet
user base.

Its also clear from the recent posts that the details of how operators like
Facebook and Google architect their applications is not well understood by
its users.

Hence we have issues reported which result in large threads which end up
being of little use to anyone, even the users of those apps.

 I refer again to the list's already written mandate:  "failures of major
communications infrastructure components having significant
traffic-carrying capacity"

This is definitely not encompassing Layer-7. I understand its important to
a set of users, thats why I suggest there ought to be a place where those
users can discuss those issues.

And a cut between L3 & Sprint, or NYC & LON, which you seem to think qualify, is still "local" and "may in turn be only a small % of the wider telecom/internet user base".

Aren't definitions fun?

Oh, please, the details of how Operators like L3 & COLT operate their fiber infrastructure is not understood by L3 & COLT!

I think the S:N ratio is orthogonal to whether it is FB, DNS, or fiber.

Assume Akamai has an outage (using an intentionally impossible scenario just to prove a point :).  Would that be "communications infrastructure"?  Akamai has essentially zero fiber.  How about "significant traffic-carrying capacity"?  Akamai has no network.  Is it useful to the outages community?

I would argue that "communications infrastructure" can easily encompass more than routers, DWDM, and fiber.  I would also argue that things which direct enormous amounts of traffic (FB, Netflix, Google, iPlayer, etc.) count, even though they do not actually _carry_ any traffic.

This list isn't for discussion, we have -discuss for that.  (And I wonder if this thread should be there?)

This list is for notification.  And I would like to be notified if 8.8.8.8 or Netflix is down.

The list owners (or a vote of the members? I don't know how this works) can decide otherwise.  But your arguments are unpersuasive.

OTOH: I don't like seeing long threads of useless info (e.g. "Is FB down?  I can't load it." with no other info) any more than the next guy.  But I repeat, that's orthogonal to the thing which is down.  We see just as many clueless "fiber cut" notices as "google is down" notices, if not more.

Fair rejoinder.

Allow me to rephrase: I think it is important to a significant fraction of the 'Net when something that is used by a significant fraction of the 'Net goes down.  The examples above are usually more relevant to more people than a single fiber cut.

And I gave you reasons why the above fits that description, which you conveniently snipped.

However, you may be right.  Or you may well be on the wrong list.  Or maybe the definition needs massaging.

Shall we define things like "infrastructure" better?  I would call the Domain Name System "communications infrastructure".  As a trivial (and hyperbolic) example, would you argue all 13 root servers going down should not be on topic?

Shall we modify the part about "traffic-carrying capacity"?  Fewer Mbps are transmitted on one of the many fiber paths between Sprint & UUNET (which are typically redundant) than Netflix pushes.  However, Netflix doesn't "carry" any traffic.  Are you going to argue Netflix is not relevant to the readers of this list?  Many (most?) see a larger traffic shift from a Netflix outage than a cut between Sprint & UU.

Then there is the fun around the word "major".  It could go on for weeks!


But let's short-circuit this entertainment and ask a more basic question: Who defines these things, and by what process?  If this list is only for fiber cuts & router crashes, then let's say so and be done with it.

It's possible, but you're not going to be able to calculate what
percentage of users it's down for;  and 5% could be a significant
outage/issue,  if you can confirm a service so large is out for 5% of
users, where that 5% is a state or a large population, then I would
say it falls under significant traffic capacity.    It's possible that
8.8.8.8  could be down for larger percentages as well;  distributed
does not mean immune to outages.

Distributed applications fail and go down systemically,  sometimes
with even more troublesome failure scenarios than localized
applications.

Such reports have some potential importance; assuming appropriate
effort was undertaken to confirm.

I can't really comment on the long threads, as they were too long, so
I didn't read them.

I don't see exactly a flood of noise here, however.

It's probably not unreasonable to suggest ignoring threads with
'Facebook'  in the subject line;   if you don't believe it counts as
significant traffic capacity,  or whichever $criteria_of_the_day  you
want to add;    the signal to noise may not be perfect, but it's not
that bad..

Well, each individual will have their own things they consider important
(hence my pizza jibe) and will want to argue are relevant to thousands of
people. But thats not a good way to maintain a low volume on-topic mailing
list. Your argument is also expanding the scope, I am trying to argue for
the status quo of what was originally said.

Correct. And that avoids mandate creep and unnecessary discussion to define
it - eg are the GTLDs important, what about google.com, what about the .biz
or .cd ?

I'd argue its important for many but off-topic. And this kind of website
discussion exists simultaneously in many *NOG mailing lists, usually
looping around the first 50 people saying who sees the service up and who
sees it down, followed by 50 posts speculating on the cause of the issue,
followed by 50 posts discussions the merits of GSLB vs anycast etc.

I don't have the desire to argue for weeks, replying this morning is

Someone defined it, wrote it down and I'll run with it. In my understanding
that means physical infrastructure failures of a significant nature, links
carrying high capacity, multiple public network operators ... I'd have no
issue making the wording more specific, but I think less specific is
opening pandora's box.

Seriously folk?

This is a public list.
Sure, sometimes folk post that they got 7.312% packet loss from their laptop to their printer.
Sometimes folk post that the images on http://www.obscure-website.com to are not loading, or are the wrong shade of green.

Different stuff is important to different folk, and people like to share their pain. Sometimes folk want to chat about "outages" that are interesting to them, or just funny, or odd, or whatever. Hey, sometimes folk also want to chat about random, off-list crap. This is not a paid service, it is a community of folk. Communities communicate.
If you try and turn this into purely a notification list (with strict rules of engagement) I suspect you will lose the folk who actually contribute.

If you are expecting to redirect this list to your pager, so you get woken up when "the Internets is down" I suspect you will (continue) to be unhappy (and sleep deprived to boot!)

Seriously folk?

This is a public list.
Sure, sometimes folk post that they got 7.312% packet loss from their laptop to their printer.
Sometimes folk post that the images on http://www.obscure-website.com to are not loading, or are the wrong shade of green.

Different stuff is important to different folk, and people like to share their pain. Sometimes folk want to chat about "outages" that are interesting to them, or just funny, or odd, or whatever. Hey, sometimes folk also want to chat about random, off-list crap. This is not a paid service, it is a community of folk. Communities communicate.
If you try and turn this into purely a notification list (with strict rules of engagement) I suspect you will lose the folk who actually contribute.

If you are expecting to redirect this list to your pager, so you get woken up when "the Internets is down" I suspect you will (continue) to be unhappy (and sleep deprived to boot!)

However, Netflix doesn't "carry" any traffic.  Are you going to argue Netflix is not relevant to the readers of this list?  Many (most?) see a larger traffic shift from a Netflix outage than a cut between Sprint & UU.

And this kind of website discussion exists simultaneously in many *NOG mailing lists, usually looping around the first 50 people saying who sees the service up and who sees it down, followed by 50 posts speculating on the cause of the issue, followed by 50 posts discussions the merits of GSLB vs anycast etc.

Precisely. Although when the discussion about the stupid Facebook joke greatly exceeds the annoyance caused by the joke it seems even sillier. Can we just resume SOP and cut the chatter?

One thing has been conclusively established by all this, beyond any doubt.

Any moderation formerly in force on the Outages list is down. Hard.

Moderation is laughing so hard that nothing can be done anymore?

Message-ID: <5116DCBD.2070300@outages.org>

Hi,

A reminder to all list members that:

The OUTAGES list has over several thousand subscribers so it is very 
easy for a
thread to have scores of posts while being off-topic and only of 
interest to only a small proportion of subscribers. Please consider 
before each post if your email will be of interest to the majority of 
members or might alternatively be emailed directly the people of 
interest or posted to another forum.

I have reached out to certain individuals requesting to end this kabuki. 
I would urge to the people on this list to use their good sense kindly 
abide by the AUP.

If you are so insistence of making your voice heard that is unrelated to 
outages I urge you to a non-outages mailing list. If it is post outages 
related, please use 'outages-discussion' list. Kindly avoid FLAME throwing.

Please don't make us ban people or turn on moderation because for the 
most part the list is working just fine, it makes work for us and takes 
away from our work/family time.

Please read the FAQ and AUP policy before posting for more details at, 
http://wiki.outages.org/index.php/Code_of_Conduct

You may direct feedback to me personally.


regards,
/virendra

	+1 and thank you Virendra for all you do to make this list the helpful
forum that it has become. 
	We should be able to police ourselves. Type once, read twice, edit if
you feel it necessary, then hit send.

Message-ID: <042d01ce0956$3cda73f0$b68f5bd0$@org>

 

We have T1 circuits (from XO) in Chicago that have been down since around
06:30am CT on February 11th. Just learned that the LEC (Windstream/Paetec)
is claiming this is a "widespread" outage related to their Cable network,
precipitated by a facility fire. The rub is that Windstream refuses to
provide an ETA or master ticket number. ;-(

 

Anyone with a direct Windstream relationship have details? Perhaps an ETA?

I saw IPv6 access to www.qwest.com <http://www.qwest.com>  and www.centurylink.com <http://www.centurylink.com>  drop out between 9:54 and 10:00 pm Central, but it?s been stable since then.  So outage time frames seem to match up.

Good Evening,

 

Any other carrier seeing intermittent issues with AS209 at a national level? We maintain QW/CTL IP transit circuits in just about every state, with the appearance of all sites affected, from multiple external (off-net) monitoring facilities.

 

We noticed all former Qwest and current CenturyLink IP transit circuits bounced from 10:53:51 through until 11:03:47 and have noticed intermittent packet-loss since. 

 

Thanks,

To follow up, I have a Century-Link / Savvis engineer on the phone stating that the route flap is related to an emergency code update to their border routers related to last nights similar outage.  Notifications would've been fantastic.

Our CenturyLink rep told us we would have to be "approved" to get
advance notifications of planned outages (and then we never heard
anything).  Great way to run a network.

You can actually use
http://www.centurylinkservices.net/events.<http://www.centurylinkservices.net/events>
to
sign up. I signed up with much issue, you just select the area you want
notices for later, and whether you want just unplanned outages, planned, or
both.

Traceroutes appear to be broken due to policy (ACL) on their end, but I'm 
able to send queries to and receive answers from 208.67.222.222 and 
208.67.220.220.  My currently prefered path to them is Level3.

That is true but I find these to be only moderately useful, and a lot of
work to keep up with if you really care.  You need to know how to
interpret the little information they gave you: the name of your
upstream switches.  These notifications are useful for the "big picture"
and if you're willing to make some calls you might even find out if a
planned maintenance will affect you, but often you won't.  Good luck
with that.

Hi Josh, list,

We had a packet-loss problem with one of our carriers in Ashburn this
morning. This problem should be resolved now.

Also see: http://system.opendns.com/

Should you still experience connectivity issues please contact us off
list at noc at opendns

Cheers,

Message-ID: <41E754F9CDC14143A82F633E93E8BA841611E119@NVP-MAIL.nvoicepay.com>

Does anyone here use Vitelity?  They appear to be down (again), completely unreachable by phone or website and our entire phone system is down as well.  This seems to be happening on a regular basis, just wondering if anyone else uses them or has any information about what's going on.

Thanks

Yes - we are seeing packet loss to some of the inbound Vitelity servers,
and are getting reports from clients of either no call availability or
poor call quality

I see their main web site is not coming up fully but if you log directly
into their portal at https://portal.vitelity.net/login.php it seems to work
fine.  I tested a handful of my numbers with them and they all seem to be
up and in service.  In my experience they have been a reliable carrier for
the past two years or so.

We use them lightly, and had trouble reported on one 310-area number about
30 minutes ago.  By the time the ticket was picked up, there was no problem
(about 15 minutes ago).

At approx. 1:57pm EST we lost both our peering sessions with Level3. At
2:00pm EST we lost physical connectivity to them.

Just got off the phone with them and they confirmed the router we peer with
is hard-down .

Anyone else affected by this? Our ticket # is 6336015..

Calls toward our VTN's in the greater Columbus, OH region have been failing since around 12pm EST. The triage guy who answered their enterprise support line said that at least 10 of their DS3's with various ILEC's in the area are down, and it is causing major outages in the Michigan/Ohio area. He wasn't sure if it was a fiber cut or an equipment problem, and didn't have an ETA.

Confirmed.  We have a 10GE hard down at approximately the same time.  According to Level3 the whole router died and they are replacing it.  How does that happen?  Did someone take a sledge hammer to it?

In reference to Alex Forster -- From our Windstream account manager, there's two "impairments" affecting their network; one in South Bend, IN, on the US Signal Network plus up to two fiber cuts in the Columbus, OH, area.  Our WS service has been out since just prior to lunch.  We do some work with some offices using Time Warner fibre and AT&T and those are still up.  I'm told this is causing issues in Indiana (northern?), Columbus & Cleveland, OH, and Wheeling, WV, and now, per Alex, also in Michigan.

For the next 140 characters, this moderator will conduct a test of the
'Is Outages Still Working' system. This is only a test.

[ No reply necessary; if the list forwards it, then it was just a quiet

Subject: [outages] XO 718-919 prefix DIDs
Message-ID: <CAL7-y60MUgH+XU6mRBGC0JFfL-uhArmVYzGHrWLk3oBHy+hy3Q@mail.gmail.com>

I have 3 DIDs in this prefix that are all down right now.  Seems XO is
having some issue there as we're not receiving inbound calls and going to a
reorder.  Anyone have any information on this?
