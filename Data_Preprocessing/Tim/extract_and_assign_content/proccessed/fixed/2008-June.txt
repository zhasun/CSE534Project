	You can post to outages at isotf.org now, still working on

I had just reset the MTR counters, sorry.  I have been getting bounced
out of apps all day.  Here is an MTR running for the last 30 minutes.
Smokeping is also showing 4.37 avg loss, 44.41 max loss and 9.53 current
loss (png attached if it goes through ?)

Thanks
Eric

FYI In case someone can get this to a clue-ful individual.  There was
been severe packet loss at Hop 11 below since 11AM EST this morning
leaving Comcast Mass network out through Level 3 NY/Boston. 

I tried to report to Comcast (Request Summary: ID:  6863600) and was met
with less than pleasant clue.  So much for being a good net'izen.  I
agreed my "connection" was fine, but past that there was an issue.  If
there is actually a way to report to Comcast NOC, please advise.

I've also reported to Internap from my side so they can investigate as
well.

Thanks
Eric

Subject: [outages] Level 3 Boston (Comcast NY) handoff packet loss since 11AM EST
Message-ID: <42F2995AD6FA0C4CA1EFBFD0CD3E9ABE0128110E@exch01.axsdom.local>

FYI In case someone can get this to a clue-ful individual.  There was
been severe packet loss at Hop 11 below since 11AM EST this morning
leaving Comcast Mass network out through Level 3 NY/Boston. 

I tried to report to Comcast (Request Summary: ID:  6863600) and was met
with less than pleasant clue.  So much for being a good net'izen.  I
agreed my "connection" was fine, but past that there was an issue.  If
there is actually a way to report to Comcast NOC, please advise.

I've also reported to Internap from my side so they can investigate as
well.

Thanks
Eric

Hello All,

First off I would like to thank everyone for their patience during the
transition period of isotf.org over to Jared's host (puck) and his
willingness to even help after repeatedly nagging and trying his
patience primarily by me.

As Jared mentioned there are still a couple more things that needs to be
hashed out (behind the scenes) while outages mailing list function to
operate normally.

We will give outages mailing list a few more weeks to operate under
isotf.org after which we will be looking at making one final transition
(in parallel) to outages.org domain as mentioned in my earlier e-mail.

Along w/ its new identity we will be looking at setting WIKI for
documentation purposes as discussed earlier.

Once again, we will be counting on the network operator community for
help in order to make outages wiki resourceful and meaningful so
everyone can benefit from the outcome. We will be communicating more on
this in the weeks to come.

Like always, I'm open for suggestions / feedback.

Many thanks to Jared Mauch, Gadi Evron and Randy Vaughn for their
relentless help during this migration.


regards,
/virendra

You'll noticed that particular page is labeled "general."  That page is as 
you describe, the general goals to reach.  But having a "general" page may 
also imply there are other pages which identify specific system design 
elements and choices you may make ranging from siting, architectural, 
civil, electrical, mechanical, piping, operations and maintance, fire
and safety and so on.  You would probably end up with a book a couple of 
hundred pages long.

My purpose with publically posting the "general" page was to respond
to the question people used to ask me.  How do you design a data center,
and my answer was "What's you goal for the datacenter."  There isn't one
goal for a data center, so there also isn't one data center design.

People kept getting hung up on whether a data center was N-2+3^0 
redundant; and not spending the time figuring out their actual goals.
Depending on your goals, one super data center may be appropriate for
you, or a few cheap data centers in different cities may be appropriate
for you, or something completely different may be appropriate for you.

But in any case, start the discussion about what you are trying to 
achieve.

You should have kept the traceroute running.  They might be passing  
packets back and fourth a couple of dozen times as a practical joke  
before eventually delivering the traffic to the next hop.

I don't know much about cogent's naming scheme, but that traceroute  
could be packets following a customer-announced aggregate and, lacking  
a more-specific in the IGP, following a default back out to cogentland.

Complete traceroute for the interested...  (FWIW, 205.232.34.1 is the DNS for a small ISP in central NY.)  At this point, I cannot determine whether they have dropped off the map or whether Cogent is just mis-routing traffic...I don't have another host on the other side of Cogent's cloud to trace to.

Also call USLEC, it seems it might be a problem on their side, because  
it reaches cogent's uslec edge obviously.

It's reachable from here, but not through Cogent.

We can keep this list usable if used sparingly.
We don't need everyone's traceroute.
Hardly useful for others anyway unless they're your roommate.
Post your outage. Move on with your day.
Leave the traceroutes for off list interchange.

Might helpful to call the ISP (http://www.lightlink.com/light.html) and ask
the person to trace back to you and see if they seem the same thing.

 

If 205.232.34.1 is their DNS server, it doesn't match what's in the DNS for
lightlink.com.  They also might considering renaming the reverse for this
DNS server to something that makes a bit more sense than
205.232.34.1.lightlink.com.

FWIW, I see the same thing from a different source (72.20.106.2):

Going through GLBX I get right to 205.232.34.1....

The problem seems closer to the zloc rather than cogent.

Both routes go through 66.152.113.44 ,,,,   Maybe local firewall/acl  
rule @FINGER LAKES TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC.?

Sorry for the caps but cut/pasted from rwhois :-)

Correct me if you see different results :-)

It occurs to me that this list may in the future be better served by two 
lists - one for outage announcements, and one for discussion.  However, 
as this is currently the only list, I'll begin here.

One of the topics I would like to see on an outages wiki would be a list 
  of sites one could check for outages.  See 
http://www.bgp4.net/wiki/doku.php?id=links:network_status for an old 
example that never really got off the ground.   I don't really care 
where such a list lives - but I've wanted one more than once.  Does 
anyone have any good links?

What other kinds of topics would be good for an outages wiki?  At first 
I was thinking that major outages (undersea cables, etc.) could be 
posted & available via RSS, but I don't see that being kept up to date 
well in the long run.  Point being, someone would need to keep it up to 
date, and when things are really, really fubar, I imagine most of the 
people here will be busy with other things. ;-)

What about good, old-fashioned IRC for live discussion of outages, 
sharing of tracerts etc? The mailing list could then be used for planned 
outage announcements, updates of current outage status and other 
announcement-style posts.

The wiki could host less volatile information - tools, techniques, 
public NOC contacts, etc.

We have a mailing list, maybe soon a wiki. No IRC right now (yet) or our 
community would die.

Actually, you have that backwards.

If somebody posts a traceroute from a vastly different network location,
that tells you something.  In the thread that you're apparently commenting
on, Jay Hennigan posted a traceroute that *worked* when going via Level3,
which tells us that lightlink.com is in fact up-and-running, and the routing
issue is probably Cogent-specific.

I think the question really is - is this list designed for *reporting*  
and confirming outages?  Or is it designed for *diagnosing*/discussing/ 
troubleshooting outages?

If someone reports an outage, there is a degree of working with the  
reporter to confirm the outage that is necessary.  (i.e. "AIM isn't  
working for me" and others either confirming or saying that it does  
work for them.)  There have, though, been a couple of threads where  
this exchange has seemed to go on for a bit more than simple  
confirmation and dived more into troubleshooting.

The "reporting/confirming" type of list is a lower-traffic kind of  
list that's more announcement/alert-oriented.  The "diagnosing/ 
discussing" type of list could be a much higher-traffic list.    Both  
are worthwhile types of lists to have... but they also may attract  
different subscribers.

Based on a couple of comments I've seen here, I think some folks may  
have signed up thinking they were getting the first type of list and  
are less interested in the second type of list.  They may be more  
interested in "alerts" and not interested in "discussion".

I don't have a great solution to offer... I think the "community" here  
is probably too new to split into separate "alerts" and "discussion"  
lists.  I also personally don't care which type of list it is.  But I  
would suggest this difference in expectations is perhaps at the route  
of the original comment and others that have been on the list.

My 2 cents,
Dan

I like your breakdown.  How about a general consensus to preface subject lines with either "Outage" or "Discussion" until there is enough momentum to break the list into two?

I've pretty much be lurker (not being currently employed, and all) but
it appears to me that this list, like others that generate a fair amount 
of meta-discussion, has two main constituencies:

People that write about that which interests me.
People that write about that which is a complete and utter waste of packets.

Great feedback.

Lot of times the outages that are being reported could be specific to
one's local PE which may or may not impact others. In others words, the
outages that are being reported may not be confirmed until we have some
sort of feedback from user community confirming the same which I agree
could lead into outages discussion.
Until we establish that relationship/openness between network operator
community and providers we may have to rely on operator community
feedback confirming outage(s) and at the same time keeping it to a minimum.

Now if providers could be little more forthcoming and start reporting
their maintenance and outages then sure I can see those alerts being
filtered into something like 'outages-alerts' but until that happens I
think we may  need to feel the list further.


Thoughts?

I understood the former. It's called outages I want my outages
pure and simple and not cut with possible outages "is teh interwebs
broken, btw I can't print either" :)

There's enough noise and html already I was considering giving up
but the move to puck gave me hope it'll evolve into something useful
to me. If it doesn't then no problem it's probably useful to someone
else.

I don't have a great solution to offer... I think the "community" here  
is probably too new to split into separate "alerts" and "discussion"  
lists.  I also personally don't care which type of list it is.  But I  
would suggest this difference in expectations is perhaps at the route  
of the original comment and others that have been on the list.
---------------------------------------------------------


When a subject becomes uninteresting to a person, all he/she has to do is select based on the subject line and mass delete the thread.  It's not too hard.  I don't think the list has enough momentum to fragment it already.  

It would be nice, though, if folks could clean up the traceroutes a bit before posting.  For example, remove the delay times when just showing there's connectivity to a particular destination.  Many traceroutes are a hard to read mess.

Whilst I appreciate that it's ironic that I'm adding to the noise I am  
about to say I would prefer not to see, I found this list most  
attractive and useful so far when it was nothing more than brief  
statements of things that were broken, with no analysis. Ideally (in

other meta-chat would happen somewhere else where I couldn't see it.

I like the discussion of any outage related issue, both reporting, 
confirming, and troubleshooting.
Now the divulging into areas such as "who still uses ICQ/AIM" and why 
they should/should not/whether or not it's secure is way off base.

That trick *never* works.

People who are not interested in discussion -- and those who are, say, 
forwarding to a Blackberry -- should probably filter out messages whose
subject lines include "[Rr][Ee]: ".

When I signed up for outages I was really hoping for something like what Sean Donelan used to do for Nanog. He had an occupation where he knew about every major cable cut or issue and reported it to the Nanog mailing list. I really miss that level of outage knowledge that we used to see.
 
I think that something like outages alert could work even with the current group. The issue is one of is it a real issue that affects a large enough group. For this I think the mailing list with the website could put in a voting idea. Using a footer in the message people could click that to vote and say this is a confirmed issue and select if it's minor or major and regional or larger impact. After a set number of votes hit then the system could send an email to outage-alerts which would be a much lower traffic but a much higher confidence list. That would allow outages to still discuss troubleshooting without imapct the blackberry and pager audience.
 
I have always looked for a way to be alerted to outages but only one's that truly are an issue. Maybe this is one way to accomplish that ?

Howdy folks.  I don't post much here ,but since this is about the  
list, here's my two cents.

I think there are more than two (report, discussion) topics reltated  
to an outage.  Here's my list, including what I would find informative  
(useful) vs. interesting (take it or leave it)  vs. annoying (leave  
it).  This is assuming that the outage is a major network outage  
(affects more than a handful of sites).  I'm not really interested to  
know that myspace or facebook is down again?i get enough of that on  
the nanog list.

1) planned outages. These would be informative if they met the  
criteria but the fact that AboveNet is doing yet another switch  
upgrade at boone doesn't really qualify.  Also any planned maintenance  
is nto a planned outage.
2) Current outages (reporting outages as they are happening-e.g. So- 
and-so is down here-or-there): informative.
3) Troubleshooting.  Take it elsewhere.  If you want a traceroute from  
Burkina Fasso, fine a looking glass.  On a sidenote, I would be OK  
with someone actually currently working for an outage asking for some  
type of help from the list (e.g. a traceroute from specific areas) but  
replies should not go to the list
4) Ongoing outage discussion.  This can be very informative and  
interesting if there's real data on a real outage (e.g. ordered new  
parts for X equipment, expect delivery in Y hours, back up in Z  
time).  Better yet, however, the original outage post should have a  
link where updates are provided for those interested.
5) post-mortem.  This is always helpful.  At best it helps us learn  
from our mistakes, at worst it makes me feel better knowing I'm not  
the only idiot out here.
6) ad-nauseum post-mortem discussion.  This can be between interesting  
and annoying?but if kept within a thread I can delete the whole  
thread.  Mostly these start out interesting and then turn into  
opinionated banter.

However many of these there are, I would still like to see only one  
thread per outage. If I want to drill further, I can read all the  
replies.

Bottom line: I read this list before I read the news, so things like  
the issues with florida a few months back, or a network outage, etc,   
are what I would like to see here.   After the outage, a description  
of what happened is also nice to have, as is ongoing reports for  
_major_ outages.  Anything more becomes noise.

Best,
Y

That trick never works *either*.

I suspect what we're going to have to do is set up an outage-notify list, 
with a companion -post (as nanog does), and let people volunteer to
summarize from the discussion list to -notify once some actual facts
have been gleaned from the discussions.

So, for last week, we might have seen

Service: AIM
Problem: Clients won't connect
Scope: Nationwide
Since: 1015
Reporter: jra at baylink.com
Confirmed: 12 users
Official? No

Service: AIM
Problem: Netsplit
Scope: Certain servers; correlation unclear
Since: 1015
Reporter: up at 3.am

Service: L3 transport USA:NE
Problem: Routing loop; link backhoed
Scope: AS 18467
Since: 1330
Reporter: somebody at somewhere.com
Confirmed: L3 ticket 772893-338
Official? Yes

each in an email from whomever did the summary.

Would this serve?

Unless we have our own NOC or staff it with volunteers like SANS, it's going
to be hard to make sure that such notifications are timely.

Unfortunately, e-mail is where it's at, and I think adding and
outages-discussion listserv would solve about 75% of the noise concern for
those who want to know *just* about outages.

That trick never works *either*.

I suspect what we're going to have to do is set up an outage-notify list, 
with a companion -post (as nanog does), and let people volunteer to
summarize from the discussion list to -notify once some actual facts
have been gleaned from the discussions.

So, for last week, we might have seen

Service: AIM
Problem: Clients won't connect
Scope: Nationwide
Since: 1015
Reporter: jra at baylink.com
Confirmed: 12 users
Official? No

Service: AIM
Problem: Netsplit
Scope: Certain servers; correlation unclear
Since: 1015
Reporter: up at 3.am
Confirmed: 6 users
Official? No

Service: L3 transport USA:NE
Problem: Routing loop; link backhoed
Scope: AS 18467
Since: 1330
Reporter: somebody at somewhere.com
Confirmed: L3 ticket 772893-338
Official? Yes

each in an email from whomever did the summary.

Would this serve?

Cheers,

Can we set up -discuss and mung the reply-to header on -notify to point to it?

Let me suggest 'mtr -r -c 5'.

I don't have a problem with discussion because I use a mail client (mutt)
that nicely threads discussion.  So if I see a reported outage (and
subsequent discussion/analysis) that I care about: I read it all.  If I
see one that that I don't care about: it's trivially easy to ignore.

So as long as the "Subject" line is apropos (and is modified if it
becomes apparent that the actual outage doesn't fit the orginally
chosen subject) then I'd have no problem keeping up with this list
even if volume increased many times over.

And while the wiki is nice, I think it best to keep outage-related
discussions in a text-only forum that can be read and written by
people on alternative/slow/low-bandwidth connections -- because they
may well be compelled to use those *because* of an outage.

I agree. The only time I need this list is when I am out working
a live webcast for JP Morgan as part of a contract crew and I don't
have time to read email. I typically only check outages during my
12-14 hour shift so that I can tell my boss why some CEO can't see
the presentation his CFO just made.

I want the facts, naked and pure and above all, short.

Extremely useful - as much as discussion is interesting and informative, 
for pager/blackberry/smartphone usefulness, Jay's format is probably 
most useable day to day. A lot of work though for someone(s).

Thus, the two list idea -notify and -post or -discussion is very 
appealing. Aggregated posts as laid out below could come later (probably 
on discussion)

An outage is an issue if you're on one side of it trying to reach 
resources on the other side.  If not, then it's not.

I was chastised for posting a traceroute here in an attempt to resolve 
the question as to whether a route loop was within Cogent or at the 
destination AS.  IMNSHO this type of thing helps to define and isolate 
the outage.

I think you covered it best. While outages does have some operational 
troubleshooting and peer-support going on, it is under the same threads.

While imperfect, I agree completely that the community is too new to 
split. I think peer moderation and mail filters worked pretty good for us 
so far.

Let's see if it keeps working, then I guess we can turn to 
meta-discussion.

I realize it takes time for folks to read such "stop" emails, but 
now that we all had time to share our take on the subject, members 
are requested to take meta-discussion off-list.

I believe we have partial concensus that we prefer to hear about actual 
outages, and that discussion should not be "outlawed" quite yet, but 
self-moderation is encouraged.

We know this model works from the past few months, now that the list is 
kindly hosted by Jared on puck, things should return to normal, and we 
will see how things go from here.

Sheesh... can you tell I was doing presentations about VoIP all day at

I had just reset the MTR counters, sorry.  I have been getting bounced
out of apps all day.  Here is an MTR running for the last 30 minutes.
Smokeping is also showing 4.37 avg loss, 44.41 max loss and 9.53 current
loss (png attached if it goes through ?)

Thanks
Eric

Message-ID: <42F2995AD6FA0C4CA1EFBFD0CD3E9ABE0128110E@exch01.axsdom.local>

FYI In case someone can get this to a clue-ful individual.  There was
been severe packet loss at Hop 11 below since 11AM EST this morning
leaving Comcast Mass network out through Level 3 NY/Boston. 

I tried to report to Comcast (Request Summary: ID:  6863600) and was met
with less than pleasant clue.  So much for being a good net'izen.  I
agreed my "connection" was fine, but past that there was an issue.  If
there is actually a way to report to Comcast NOC, please advise.

I've also reported to Internap from my side so they can investigate as
well.

Thanks
Eric

Subject: [outages] Level 3 Boston (Comcast NY) handoff packet loss since 11AM EST
Message-ID: <42F2995AD6FA0C4CA1EFBFD0CD3E9ABE0128110E@exch01.axsdom.local>

FYI In case someone can get this to a clue-ful individual.  There was
been severe packet loss at Hop 11 below since 11AM EST this morning
leaving Comcast Mass network out through Level 3 NY/Boston. 

I tried to report to Comcast (Request Summary: ID:  6863600) and was met
with less than pleasant clue.  So much for being a good net'izen.  I
agreed my "connection" was fine, but past that there was an issue.  If
there is actually a way to report to Comcast NOC, please advise.

I've also reported to Internap from my side so they can investigate as
well.

Thanks
Eric

Hello All,

First off I would like to thank everyone for their patience during the
transition period of isotf.org over to Jared's host (puck) and his
willingness to even help after repeatedly nagging and trying his
patience primarily by me.

As Jared mentioned there are still a couple more things that needs to be
hashed out (behind the scenes) while outages mailing list function to
operate normally.

We will give outages mailing list a few more weeks to operate under
isotf.org after which we will be looking at making one final transition
(in parallel) to outages.org domain as mentioned in my earlier e-mail.

Along w/ its new identity we will be looking at setting WIKI for
documentation purposes as discussed earlier.

Once again, we will be counting on the network operator community for
help in order to make outages wiki resourceful and meaningful so
everyone can benefit from the outcome. We will be communicating more on
this in the weeks to come.

Like always, I'm open for suggestions / feedback.

Many thanks to Jared Mauch, Gadi Evron and Randy Vaughn for their
relentless help during this migration.


regards,
/virendra

You'll noticed that particular page is labeled "general."  That page is as 
you describe, the general goals to reach.  But having a "general" page may 
also imply there are other pages which identify specific system design 
elements and choices you may make ranging from siting, architectural, 
civil, electrical, mechanical, piping, operations and maintance, fire
and safety and so on.  You would probably end up with a book a couple of 
hundred pages long.

My purpose with publically posting the "general" page was to respond
to the question people used to ask me.  How do you design a data center,
and my answer was "What's you goal for the datacenter."  There isn't one
goal for a data center, so there also isn't one data center design.

People kept getting hung up on whether a data center was N-2+3^0 
redundant; and not spending the time figuring out their actual goals.
Depending on your goals, one super data center may be appropriate for
you, or a few cheap data centers in different cities may be appropriate
for you, or something completely different may be appropriate for you.

But in any case, start the discussion about what you are trying to 
achieve.

You should have kept the traceroute running.  They might be passing  
packets back and fourth a couple of dozen times as a practical joke  
before eventually delivering the traffic to the next hop.

I don't know much about cogent's naming scheme, but that traceroute  
could be packets following a customer-announced aggregate and, lacking  
a more-specific in the IGP, following a default back out to cogentland.

Complete traceroute for the interested...  (FWIW, 205.232.34.1 is the DNS for a small ISP in central NY.)  At this point, I cannot determine whether they have dropped off the map or whether Cogent is just mis-routing traffic...I don't have another host on the other side of Cogent's cloud to trace to.

Also call USLEC, it seems it might be a problem on their side, because  
it reaches cogent's uslec edge obviously.

It's reachable from here, but not through Cogent.

We can keep this list usable if used sparingly.
We don't need everyone's traceroute.
Hardly useful for others anyway unless they're your roommate.
Post your outage. Move on with your day.
Leave the traceroutes for off list interchange.

Might helpful to call the ISP (http://www.lightlink.com/light.html) and ask
the person to trace back to you and see if they seem the same thing.

 

If 205.232.34.1 is their DNS server, it doesn't match what's in the DNS for
lightlink.com.  They also might considering renaming the reverse for this
DNS server to something that makes a bit more sense than
205.232.34.1.lightlink.com.

traffic...I don't have another host on the other side of Cogent's cloud to
trace to.

Are you able to share what IP you're tracing to?


Is anyone else seeing some routing loops in Cogent's network?

FWIW, I see the same thing from a different source (72.20.106.2):

Going through GLBX I get right to 205.232.34.1....

The problem seems closer to the zloc rather than cogent.

Both routes go through 66.152.113.44 ,,,,   Maybe local firewall/acl  
rule @FINGER LAKES TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC.?

Sorry for the caps but cut/pasted from rwhois :-)

Correct me if you see different results :-)

It occurs to me that this list may in the future be better served by two 
lists - one for outage announcements, and one for discussion.  However, 
as this is currently the only list, I'll begin here.

One of the topics I would like to see on an outages wiki would be a list 
  of sites one could check for outages.  See 
http://www.bgp4.net/wiki/doku.php?id=links:network_status for an old 
example that never really got off the ground.   I don't really care 
where such a list lives - but I've wanted one more than once.  Does 
anyone have any good links?

What other kinds of topics would be good for an outages wiki?  At first 
I was thinking that major outages (undersea cables, etc.) could be 
posted & available via RSS, but I don't see that being kept up to date 
well in the long run.  Point being, someone would need to keep it up to 
date, and when things are really, really fubar, I imagine most of the 
people here will be busy with other things. ;-)

What about good, old-fashioned IRC for live discussion of outages, 
sharing of tracerts etc? The mailing list could then be used for planned 
outage announcements, updates of current outage status and other 
announcement-style posts.

The wiki could host less volatile information - tools, techniques, 
public NOC contacts, etc.

We have a mailing list, maybe soon a wiki. No IRC right now (yet) or our 
community would die.

Actually, you have that backwards.

If somebody posts a traceroute from a vastly different network location,
that tells you something.  In the thread that you're apparently commenting
on, Jay Hennigan posted a traceroute that *worked* when going via Level3,
which tells us that lightlink.com is in fact up-and-running, and the routing
issue is probably Cogent-specific.

I think the question really is - is this list designed for *reporting*  
and confirming outages?  Or is it designed for *diagnosing*/discussing/ 
troubleshooting outages?

If someone reports an outage, there is a degree of working with the  
reporter to confirm the outage that is necessary.  (i.e. "AIM isn't  
working for me" and others either confirming or saying that it does  
work for them.)  There have, though, been a couple of threads where  
this exchange has seemed to go on for a bit more than simple  
confirmation and dived more into troubleshooting.

The "reporting/confirming" type of list is a lower-traffic kind of  
list that's more announcement/alert-oriented.  The "diagnosing/ 
discussing" type of list could be a much higher-traffic list.    Both  
are worthwhile types of lists to have... but they also may attract  
different subscribers.

Based on a couple of comments I've seen here, I think some folks may  
have signed up thinking they were getting the first type of list and  
are less interested in the second type of list.  They may be more  
interested in "alerts" and not interested in "discussion".

I don't have a great solution to offer... I think the "community" here  
is probably too new to split into separate "alerts" and "discussion"  
lists.  I also personally don't care which type of list it is.  But I  
would suggest this difference in expectations is perhaps at the route  
of the original comment and others that have been on the list.

My 2 cents,
Dan

I like your breakdown.  How about a general consensus to preface subject lines with either "Outage" or "Discussion" until there is enough momentum to break the list into two?

I've pretty much be lurker (not being currently employed, and all) but
it appears to me that this list, like others that generate a fair amount 
of meta-discussion, has two main constituencies:

People that write about that which interests me.
People that write about that which is a complete and utter waste of packets.

Great feedback.

Lot of times the outages that are being reported could be specific to
one's local PE which may or may not impact others. In others words, the
outages that are being reported may not be confirmed until we have some
sort of feedback from user community confirming the same which I agree
could lead into outages discussion.
Until we establish that relationship/openness between network operator
community and providers we may have to rely on operator community
feedback confirming outage(s) and at the same time keeping it to a minimum.

Now if providers could be little more forthcoming and start reporting
their maintenance and outages then sure I can see those alerts being
filtered into something like 'outages-alerts' but until that happens I
think we may  need to feel the list further.


Thoughts?

I understood the former. It's called outages I want my outages
pure and simple and not cut with possible outages "is teh interwebs
broken, btw I can't print either" :)

There's enough noise and html already I was considering giving up
but the move to puck gave me hope it'll evolve into something useful
to me. If it doesn't then no problem it's probably useful to someone
else.

would suggest this difference in expectations is perhaps at the route  
of the original comment and others that have been on the list.
---------------------------------------------------------


When a subject becomes uninteresting to a person, all he/she has to do is select based on the subject line and mass delete the thread.  It's not too hard.  I don't think the list has enough momentum to fragment it already.  

It would be nice, though, if folks could clean up the traceroutes a bit before posting.  For example, remove the delay times when just showing there's connectivity to a particular destination.  Many traceroutes are a hard to read mess.

Whilst I appreciate that it's ironic that I'm adding to the noise I am  
about to say I would prefer not to see, I found this list most  
attractive and useful so far when it was nothing more than brief  
statements of things that were broken, with no analysis. Ideally (in

other meta-chat would happen somewhere else where I couldn't see it.

I like the discussion of any outage related issue, both reporting, 
confirming, and troubleshooting.
Now the divulging into areas such as "who still uses ICQ/AIM" and why 
they should/should not/whether or not it's secure is way off base.

That trick *never* works.

People who are not interested in discussion -- and those who are, say, 
forwarding to a Blackberry -- should probably filter out messages whose
subject lines include "[Rr][Ee]: ".

When I signed up for outages I was really hoping for something like what Sean Donelan used to do for Nanog. He had an occupation where he knew about every major cable cut or issue and reported it to the Nanog mailing list. I really miss that level of outage knowledge that we used to see.
 
I think that something like outages alert could work even with the current group. The issue is one of is it a real issue that affects a large enough group. For this I think the mailing list with the website could put in a voting idea. Using a footer in the message people could click that to vote and say this is a confirmed issue and select if it's minor or major and regional or larger impact. After a set number of votes hit then the system could send an email to outage-alerts which would be a much lower traffic but a much higher confidence list. That would allow outages to still discuss troubleshooting without imapct the blackberry and pager audience.
 
I have always looked for a way to be alerted to outages but only one's that truly are an issue. Maybe this is one way to accomplish that ?

Howdy folks.  I don't post much here ,but since this is about the  
list, here's my two cents.

I think there are more than two (report, discussion) topics reltated  
to an outage.  Here's my list, including what I would find informative  
(useful) vs. interesting (take it or leave it)  vs. annoying (leave  
it).  This is assuming that the outage is a major network outage  
(affects more than a handful of sites).  I'm not really interested to  
know that myspace or facebook is down again?i get enough of that on  
the nanog list.

1) planned outages. These would be informative if they met the  
criteria but the fact that AboveNet is doing yet another switch  
upgrade at boone doesn't really qualify.  Also any planned maintenance  
is nto a planned outage.
2) Current outages (reporting outages as they are happening-e.g. So- 
and-so is down here-or-there): informative.
3) Troubleshooting.  Take it elsewhere.  If you want a traceroute from  
Burkina Fasso, fine a looking glass.  On a sidenote, I would be OK  
with someone actually currently working for an outage asking for some  
type of help from the list (e.g. a traceroute from specific areas) but  
replies should not go to the list
4) Ongoing outage discussion.  This can be very informative and  
interesting if there's real data on a real outage (e.g. ordered new  
parts for X equipment, expect delivery in Y hours, back up in Z  
time).  Better yet, however, the original outage post should have a  
link where updates are provided for those interested.
5) post-mortem.  This is always helpful.  At best it helps us learn  
from our mistakes, at worst it makes me feel better knowing I'm not  
the only idiot out here.
6) ad-nauseum post-mortem discussion.  This can be between interesting  
and annoying?but if kept within a thread I can delete the whole  
thread.  Mostly these start out interesting and then turn into  
opinionated banter.

However many of these there are, I would still like to see only one  
thread per outage. If I want to drill further, I can read all the  
replies.

Bottom line: I read this list before I read the news, so things like  
the issues with florida a few months back, or a network outage, etc,   
are what I would like to see here.   After the outage, a description  
of what happened is also nice to have, as is ongoing reports for  
_major_ outages.  Anything more becomes noise.

Best,
Y

That trick never works *either*.

I suspect what we're going to have to do is set up an outage-notify list, 
with a companion -post (as nanog does), and let people volunteer to
summarize from the discussion list to -notify once some actual facts
have been gleaned from the discussions.

So, for last week, we might have seen

Service: AIM
Problem: Clients won't connect
Scope: Nationwide
Since: 1015
Reporter: jra at baylink.com
Confirmed: 12 users
Official? No

Service: AIM
Problem: Netsplit
Scope: Certain servers; correlation unclear
Since: 1015
Reporter: up at 3.am
Confirmed: 6 users
Official? No

Service: L3 transport USA:NE
Problem: Routing loop; link backhoed
Scope: AS 18467
Since: 1330
Reporter: somebody at somewhere.com
Confirmed: L3 ticket 772893-338
Official? Yes

each in an email from whomever did the summary.

Would this serve?

Unless we have our own NOC or staff it with volunteers like SANS, it's going
to be hard to make sure that such notifications are timely.

Unfortunately, e-mail is where it's at, and I think adding and
outages-discussion listserv would solve about 75% of the noise concern for
those who want to know *just* about outages.

That trick never works *either*.

I suspect what we're going to have to do is set up an outage-notify list, 
with a companion -post (as nanog does), and let people volunteer to
summarize from the discussion list to -notify once some actual facts
have been gleaned from the discussions.

So, for last week, we might have seen

Service: AIM
Problem: Clients won't connect
Scope: Nationwide
Since: 1015
Reporter: jra at baylink.com
Confirmed: 12 users
Official? No

Service: AIM
Problem: Netsplit
Scope: Certain servers; correlation unclear
Since: 1015
Reporter: up at 3.am
Confirmed: 6 users
Official? No

Service: L3 transport USA:NE
Problem: Routing loop; link backhoed
Scope: AS 18467
Since: 1330
Reporter: somebody at somewhere.com
Confirmed: L3 ticket 772893-338
Official? Yes

each in an email from whomever did the summary.

Would this serve?

Cheers,

Can we set up -discuss and mung the reply-to header on -notify to point to it?

Let me suggest 'mtr -r -c 5'.

-c 10, if you have the patience.

I don't have a problem with discussion because I use a mail client (mutt)
that nicely threads discussion.  So if I see a reported outage (and
subsequent discussion/analysis) that I care about: I read it all.  If I
see one that that I don't care about: it's trivially easy to ignore.

So as long as the "Subject" line is apropos (and is modified if it
becomes apparent that the actual outage doesn't fit the orginally
chosen subject) then I'd have no problem keeping up with this list
even if volume increased many times over.

And while the wiki is nice, I think it best to keep outage-related
discussions in a text-only forum that can be read and written by
people on alternative/slow/low-bandwidth connections -- because they
may well be compelled to use those *because* of an outage.

I agree. The only time I need this list is when I am out working
a live webcast for JP Morgan as part of a contract crew and I don't
have time to read email. I typically only check outages during my
12-14 hour shift so that I can tell my boss why some CEO can't see
the presentation his CFO just made.

I want the facts, naked and pure and above all, short.

Extremely useful - as much as discussion is interesting and informative, 
for pager/blackberry/smartphone usefulness, Jay's format is probably 
most useable day to day. A lot of work though for someone(s).

Thus, the two list idea -notify and -post or -discussion is very 
appealing. Aggregated posts as laid out below could come later (probably 
on discussion)

An outage is an issue if you're on one side of it trying to reach 
resources on the other side.  If not, then it's not.

I was chastised for posting a traceroute here in an attempt to resolve 
the question as to whether a route loop was within Cogent or at the 
destination AS.  IMNSHO this type of thing helps to define and isolate 
the outage.

I think you covered it best. While outages does have some operational 
troubleshooting and peer-support going on, it is under the same threads.

While imperfect, I agree completely that the community is too new to 
split. I think peer moderation and mail filters worked pretty good for us 
so far.

Let's see if it keeps working, then I guess we can turn to 
meta-discussion.

I realize it takes time for folks to read such "stop" emails, but 
now that we all had time to share our take on the subject, members 
are requested to take meta-discussion off-list.

I believe we have partial concensus that we prefer to hear about actual 
outages, and that discussion should not be "outlawed" quite yet, but 
self-moderation is encouraged.

We know this model works from the past few months, now that the list is 
kindly hosted by Jared on puck, things should return to normal, and we 
will see how things go from here.

 	Gadi.

Sheesh... can you tell I was doing presentations about VoIP all day at
