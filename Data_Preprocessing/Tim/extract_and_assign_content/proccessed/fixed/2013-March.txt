Subject: [outages] Problems in APAC?
Message-ID: <CAMhuimi+Le5S3e8bHr22yqH=X2oTf8S_ava+kcwo4d4Kec-sYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Having problems resolving names from CloudFlare and other vendors (e.g.
citibank.co.in) from from BNSL in New Delhi and Optus in Melbourne. Is
anyone aware of any issues in that region with DNS or connectivity?

I don't have any more info than that at the moment. Outage has currently
been more than 15 minutes.

Thanks!

Ken

Message-ID: <5133F0D6.8000505@outages.org>

Hi,

Apparently we lost connection to our site in sydney, australia off 
verizon side. The circuit came up just about 10 mins back but we've been 
told this was a transport layer issue that was caused on the local PTT 
(telstra) side.

Apparently this took down about 78 customers on Verizon side.

Does anyone have any insight?

This Sunday, 0159595EST will be followed by 030000EDT, in most areas.

Amazing as it sounds, even this late in the day there are *still* things
that don't deal with the DST switchover properly.  If you have problems
on Sunday, this is definitely an item to have on your checklist.

Amazon's AWS dashboard has all greens and the page loads fine for me.  No
chatter on twitter about anything like this.  There seem to be no broader
indications that there's an issue at this time.

Amazon also looking fine from VZW 4g.  Some recent reports on NANOG of 
problems with yahoo.com, with the obligatory snark about telecommuting, 
but it's ok here too.

Blake,

1. You need to provide traceroutes from both endpoints, given the
very likely possibility of asymmetric routing,

2. You need to provide both source and destination IP addresses,

3. Please make sure your destinations are not routers -- they need to be
actual hosts.  If network or host ACLs/firewalls inhibit the ability to
reach the destinations, that can make things a bit more difficult given
the possibility of ICMP prioritisation.  I say this with acknowledgement
of your statement that the same hop tends to show 60ms during normal
hours but increases during evenings.

Necessary details/specifics are covered here:

Thanks.

Sorry about that.  The reflexive tracert is below.  I would rather not list source and destination addresses on a public list.

Was the below Sprint->Comcast traceroute taken while the issue was/is
still actively happening?

You should probably do multiple traceroutes from both endpoints, or get
better tools like mtr/WinMTR which can do this repeatedly.

What you've shown below indicates that you're only seeing an increase in
latency on the ingress side of the Sprint connection (i.e.
Comcast->Sprint), starting at one specific router (hop #13) on the
Sprint side.

If this was an actual service-impacting issue, you would be seeing an
increase in latency on the egress (Sprint->Comcast) traceroute as well,
given that traceroute attempts to solicit an ICMP time-exceeded message
from a device; think round-trip-time and how response packets "should"
take the same path that your Comcast->Sprint traceroute would.

Phrased differently: if the issue is actively happening, you should be
seeing "spiky" latency in both the Comcast->Sprint and Sprint->Comcast
traceroutes, just at different hops/network points.

What you've shown below refutes that, which to me indicates ICMP
prioritisation being used on Sprint routers.

If you really wanted to bring this up with Sprint, you would need to
have a relationship with them, and you would *need* to provide source
and destination IPs.

I would recommend setting up scripts/tools that run mtr from a cronjob
and save the output to a file, and do this on hosts at both ends of the
network (the Comcast end, and the Sprint end).

Yes the issue is actively occurring right now.  It's not consistent, I experience a smooth connection with blips of lag.  Where I am seeing this most frequently is traffic across multiple ipsec VPN's.  We doo have a peering agreement with Sprint.  That's why I emailed out, as normally I would expect to see latency on both directions.  I can most definitely provide them with source and destination IP's, I was mostly just hoping someone else might have seen something similar.  I do have smokeping running from Comcast to Sprint at the moment and it does show plenty of jitter and latency increase, however I do not have smokeping set up on the other side yet.  

Thanks for the insight, I will get in touch with our Sprint contacts to see what they think.  

Thanks,
Blake

Anyone seeing Sprint Data outages? Out of the 50 or so sites we have their
devices at only 2 or 3 are up right now across the country. Anyone else
seeing anything? I have a ticket opened on it and they confirmed we have no
blocks on our account so was wondering if anyone else is seeing anything?

And there's the point that makes fixing this stuff such a bitch: you almost
never have a relationship with anyone except the carrier you connect through
(and sometimes not even them :-).

This is, incidentally, why my professional recommendation to people setting
up "nailed up" links over the Internet is to move heaven and earth to
get every point on the same carrier, or to make sure, at the very least
that there is only one exchange point in the middle, and you're a customer
of the carrier on both sides of it.

Having to escalate through 3 or 4 carriers to get something fixed isn't 
just time consuming, it's often impossible.

Social engineering NOC hotlines (as much as I hate to advocate it) is 
often the only solution; bring your Geek License.  :-)

Cheers,

And the recommended approach is:

# mtr -rwc 10 $HOST
# mtr -rwcn 10 $HOST

(Alas, mtr won't show both the name and IP, even in report modes; I will
eventually get sick enough of that to patch it.  Yes, local misconfigs
that cause bad DNS resolution need to be visible in such report output.)

Note that mtr needs to be both setUID root *and* executable by Other
in order to work for others than root, assuming you need that.  Neither
is default.

you must have a weird OS; on mine, it's the default:

-r-sr-xr-x  1 root  bin  63016 Jul 31  2012 /usr/local/sbin/mtr

Also, any patches to make `--order "SRL BGAWV"` the default when in
`--report` mode?  Otherwise, the output is pretty much unreadable.

Or even better, just use setcap to give it permission to open RAW sockets
without having full root access.

setcap 'cap_net_raw=+ep' /usr/bin/mtr

That said, I've never seen an OS that included mtr that didn't have it
setuid by defualt.

Fair point.

I installed it on OpenSUSE 12.1 on my laptop from...

mtr-0.81-3.1.2.i586.rpm

which came from the default repo-oss, and on reinstalling it for check,
I see that it's root:dialout 4750.  So yes, it has SUID, just not the
other permissions.  That's likely not an accident, but all the machines 
I manage, I'm the only real user on, generally.

There's a fiber cut in Tomahawk, Wisconsin.  I'm speaking some colleagues
in other areas in Northern Wisconsin, and heard from a Frontier Rep that
confirmed this.

There are two ISPs in the area, as far as I know anyone using Frontier is
affected.  Badgernet (Wisconsin provider for Schools, Libraries,
Government) may also be affected.

The status on the other ISP in the area, Charter, is not known to me.

Internet service in the following cities/areas are affected:

Rhinelander
Minocqua/Hazelhurst/Arbor Vitae
Tomahawk
Crandon (including Forest County Potawatomi Nation)

I currently don't know an ETA on repairs.

Subject: [outages] Comcast and GTT/MZIMA LAX packet loss issue
Message-ID: <20130317041545.GA1466@icarus.home.lan>

For the past 3 days (roughly when the issue began), I've been seeing
signs of what may be network saturation between GTT/MZIMA and Comcast in
the Los Angeles area, or alternately an overutilised router.

The issue starts approximately around 18:00 PT and continues all the way
until roughly midnight.

Here's an example of what's happening tonight/right now:

Message-ID: <514EAD9E.9010902@neology.co.za>

This has been ongoing now for a few days and I'm surprised it hasn't yet
been mentioned here:

There are currently cable breaks on multiple cable systems running
through Egypt and surrounding areas. From what I've heard there are
breaks on I-ME-WE, TE-North, EIG and SEA-ME-WE-3.

This is affecting onward connectivity on a number of other cables such
as EASSy and Seacom as no restoration capacity is available. This is
causing capacity constraints and outages for most operators in Southern
and Eastern Africa as well as the Middle East.

ETRs of between 1 and 4 weeks depending on whether you speak to the PR
people or the engineers. ;-)

Anyone else have additional info?

We have a customer with a private MPLS circuit between San Luis Obispo, CA and San Jose.

We have a ticket open with AT&T.  This morning, hold wait times for AT&T were 6 minutes, but now the line is just ringing.  Almost like their call center is underwater with calls.

AT&T Techs this morning said "There are no alerts on your line...but then again, we can't actually SEE your line."

Anyone else out there with AT&T MPLS services in California seeing similar behavior/response?

The DDoS attack being waged against Spamhaus has reached a previously

chief architect at digital content provider Akamai. 

Recent cyber attacks -- like the ones that caused persistent outages at U.S.
banking sites late last year -- tend to peak at 100 billion bits per second.


The attack on Spamhaus clocked in at. 300 billion.

Thank you Chris.  We just received an update from AT&T that they supposedly replaced a card on a router in San Jose (although our customer is still down), so perhaps this is more limited in scope than we initially thought.  And San Jose would explain why you're not seeing any issues.  Brisbane is closer to SF.
