Subject: [outages] T-3 issues in Miami
Message-ID: <CA+TKNNZwy0i2q691zKwBGxHuv5woJTpuBiE7aFR9urwhi10=Hw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings all:

Report of a T-3 in the Miami area suffering some outages - this is
affecting multiple carriers, from what my carrier is telling me (PaeTec,
Windstream, AT&T, are known affected just to name a couple). On my end I'm
having issues with voice and data since it's all apparently in the same
bundle.

No ETA on repair, but I opened up the ticket today at 8am central, and it's
1:45pm central now so the outage is continuing.

Wish I had more folks, but this is at least a start.

-Eric

WFLA TV reports that Tampa Fire is working a hazmat call at 400 N Tampa.

  http://www.wfla.com/story/21920646/hazmat-situation-in-downtown-tampa

Park Tower is the carrier hotel for Tampa Bay; there are about 13 carriers
in that building, at least 9 of which have major POPs and xconn there.

Depending on what the actual problem is, Tampa Bay, Florida, or the
Southeast may see repercussions from this.

Followups to outages-discussion at outages.org, please (except for actual
further outage data).  (I would set followups, but Zimbra 6 sucks.)

Cheers,
-- jra

She tries to reply back, and it fails as imessage, so it resends as 
regular message and I get it.


We are both in the same metro area (Birmingham, AL)

How much you wanna bet that they're implementing interception mechanisms

672 Copley St near the square, according to Bloomberg; 100 injuries,
no confirmed fatalities; much video of the explosions due to live coverage
of the race.

It's being reported that iMessage traffic to the area is congested, and
iPhone users should disable that for more reliable communications in and
out of the city.

No official confirmation these were bombs; the T may have transformers in
that area for its subway lines.

More details on Twitter and Zello#Emergency as news progresses; followups
to -discussion please, unless they're about specific outages related to
the incident.

No other reported outages so far.

Since just after 8 PM EDT (0000 UTC 4/16), I've been receiving notices that
some of our monitored websites are experiencing heavy packet losses. I have
tracked it down to one errant IP address at GoDaddy that keeps bombing out
on traceroutes:

- be100.125.trmd0215-01.ars.mgmt.phx3.gdg (216.69.188.30)

It's causing most traffic to be unable to get through. Anyone else seeing
this?

Message-ID: <516D6219.6080101@garlic.com>

Hi,

I've got confirmed reports (from Cogent and Megapath) that there is a 
fiber cut affecting service through the South Bay.  We have Cogent fiber 
circuits down in Campbell and San Martin.   In San Martin, landlines 
have no dialtone and AT&T cell phones have no service whatsoever.  All 
calls to Gilroy landlines are failing to All Circuits Busy.


Anyone have any further details?   The issue seems to have started 
around 1:00am PDT or so.

-Robert

About 190 injuries, 3 confirmed dead, lots still in hospital, many lost limbs.

Yesterday lots of stuff was slammed, including standard cell traffic. Now everything is fine. I am close to the scene, my mobile, SMS, iMessage, and broadband are all fine (modulo a 3 minute hit on Comcast at about 0800 local). A few blocks are closed as a crime scene, at least one T (subway) stop is closed.

Confirmed bombs, considered a terrorist attack. It was two explosive devices, both included BBs or nails to inflict maximum human toll. Early reports of additional unexploded devices were incorrect. Two bombs, both exploded, within seconds of each other. FBI claims there is no further imminent danger.

No suspects in custody.

Perhaps it was poisoned, too, but as mentioned on NANOG yesterday, they
changed their A record(s) yesterday.

Hi,

I've got confirmed reports (from Cogent and Megapath) that there is a fiber cut affecting service through the South Bay.  We have Cogent fiber 
circuits down in Campbell and San Martin.   In San Martin, landlines 
have no dialtone and AT&T cell phones have no service whatsoever.  All calls to Gilroy landlines are failing to All Circuits Busy.


Anyone have any further details?   The issue seems to have started 
around 1:00am PDT or so.

-Robert

Received notification from TelePacific that AT&T experienced a fiber cut

there is no available completion time estimate at this time.

Mitch,

Yep that is exactly what I see in Megapath CONNECT as well for our
myriad of Gilroy circuits..

>From what I have gathered from various news outlets and other mailing
lists, a power substation in San Jose was vandalized, along with fiber
that runs nearby it. HAZMAT had to get the sub-station vandalism cleaned
up before AT&T could get in to start splicing.

About 190 injuries, 3 confirmed dead, lots still in hospital, many lost limbs.

Yesterday lots of stuff was slammed, including standard cell traffic. Now everything is fine. I am close to the scene, my mobile, SMS, iMessage, and broadband are all fine (modulo a 3 minute hit on Comcast at about 0800 local). A few blocks are closed as a crime scene, at least one T (subway) stop is closed.

Confirmed bombs, considered a terrorist attack. It was two explosive devices, both included BBs or nails to inflict maximum human toll. Early reports of additional unexploded devices were incorrect. Two bombs, both exploded, within seconds of each other. FBI claims there is no further imminent danger.

No suspects in custody.

All,

Just got off the horn with Cogent.  They called AT&T while they had me 
on hold, AT&T told them they have extracted the fiber, which was, 
according to them, "very heavily damaged".  They have brought a new 
cable in, and are in the process of splicing.

Yes, Level(3) did find the Fiber cut for the Sunnyvale, CA area but the cut
was in the San Jose area.  The fiber cut was spliced and fused earlier, but
re-dispatched for a customer's dark fiber strains, but other than that
everyone should back in service if affected by this cut.

*If you are experiencing a service disruption, please report the issue to
Level 3 by submitting a ticket via the MyLevel3 Portal or calling

This reminds me of my favorite Level3 article ever, about fiber cuts.

http://blog.level3.com/level-3-network/the-10-most-bizarre-and-annoying-causes-of-fiber-cuts/

Frankly, I think every fiber cut should be coupled with pictures posted about the fiber cut. Can't help but be curious sometimes!

Hi,

I've got confirmed reports (from Cogent and Megapath) that there is a fiber cut affecting service through the South Bay.  We have Cogent fiber
circuits down in Campbell and San Martin.   In San Martin, landlines
have no dialtone and AT&T cell phones have no service whatsoever.  All calls to Gilroy landlines are failing to All Circuits Busy.


Anyone have any further details?   The issue seems to have started
around 1:00am PDT or so.

Number 4 on that list happens here in my city almost weekly, whether the
lines be for telephone, cable, or power.

The residential line techs I've talked to indicate the common cause are
big rigs driving around in areas where the cables are low-hanging.  Of
course nobody reports this until there's an actual outage...  :/

Much worse, not to mention dangerous, occasionally someone with a bucket
truck forgets to lower the arm all the way and proceeds to drive around
for a while before wondering what all the noise is about.  When this
happens, it's like a trail of bread crumbs for the fire department.

Owning a scanner (e.g. fire/police/city) comes in handy for this exact
reason.

Number 5 is also a common problem here too, at least for residential
providers.  Rain doesn't tend to do much damage (barring in-line power
amps that aren't properly closed by techs), but wind is an entirely
different problem.  Goes hand in hand with Number 8.

And finally, we get number 2 too, though my city is blessed with a
"special" kind of grey squirrel: psychotic and extremely aggressive
(search Google for "Mountain View squirrels" if you think I'm kidding.
I've had "personal encounters" with them, the most notable being one
that dropped from a tree onto my handlebars while biking through a park;
it chattered at me rudely for a full 5-6 seconds *while I was still
moving*, before scurrying off somewhere.  Maybe this is what the Second
Amendment is really for... ;-) )

P.S. -- To all you field techs out there, thank you for all the hard
work you do.  You deserve a lot more credit than you get.  :-)

This happened to my neighbors about 3 years ago, in the middle of the
night.  Fortunately only took their phone and cable line out, but we heard
the "Bang" as it was pulled off the house and then the truck screeching to
a halt...

All but 2 of the 25 Covad^H^H^H^H^H Megapath circuits that were down in 
the GLRYCAXF CO are now back up.

Also, landlines and Verizon DSL is back up in parts of Gilroy. Looks 
like AT&T is making progress on the fiber splicing.

Have had a number of off-list and some on-list replies to confirm, and
Google is now saying something is wrong.  It seems to point to
authentication as the problem...

Note, "less than 0.007%" of Google Mail user base.  If Google has 100M
users, that would be just 7K customers.  I think Hope College has more than
2000 students, so it would see the problem may be broader.

    Well, well, well...

    Either something is wrong with your upstream transparent proxy...
    ( Probable )

    Or someone could have simply hijack your local google subnets (BGP
announcement) and is trying to spoof it...
    ( Unlikely in NA )

    In any case, GL.

Well, I'm now seeing the same exact not-found from ebay, on interior
pages *with the exact same Apache identifier*, so I'm blaming Sprint,
whose 4G I'm using.  Though I'm not supposed to be using their proxy.

PacWest Telecom has an inbound outage that they say began at approximately
1 am Pacific time today. I reported the outage at 5:15 am and was told
there was a hardware failure overnight and that I would be switched to a
different machine.

7:45 am and four phone calls later this remains down and no ETA is
available.

That looks a lot more likely that someone horked you.

Any proxies where you are at the moment? Can you send traceroutes?

You might want to clear the malware off your machine. ;)

Other than that, how about providing some useful information, like the
results of a DNS lookup?

Message-ID: <12633587.2873.1366302813242.JavaMail.root@benjamin.baylink.com>

I tend to forget that lots of people read lists in threaded mailers, since
I don't anymore, and therefore lots of people didn't see my folo:

I got the same error, *with the exact same Apache line* (Google doesn't 
use Apache, much less Lenny, as several people pointed out), from eBay
about half an hour later; all of that stuff was gone by half an hour after
that (exacerbated by the list mailer being somewhat cranky); the problem
has now cleared itself up.

But this was, in fact, a good example of why reports with insufficient data
are ... less useful than the other sort, and I should in fact know better.

Clearly this was, as several people suggested, a failure of some transparent
proxy along the way -- well, a *semi* transparent proxy, which rewrote the
Apache signature, when it really shouldn't have (and I have previously seen
such transparent proxies not do so, and include their own address instead
in the footer) -- and the likely candidate, given where I am just now, is
Sprint's WiMAX 4G network.

Sorry for the noise.

Cheers,

I'd generally agree, but the problem is getting the hard evidence
(packet captures would be the most useful).

Google doesn't listen on port 81 (but keep reading):

$ telnet www.google.com 81
Trying 74.125.224.50...
^C

Going to use some Apache config terminology here, so if you aren't
familiar with httpd.conf then bow out at this point:

It may be that Google has reverse-proxy servers (or LBs that can do
some of this) where the Apache servers on the back end (think
192.168.x.x), listen on TCP port 81, for /search requests.  These srvers
could use NameVirtualHost to ensure that they honour a Host: header of
www.google.com too.

Those servers could have their ServerTokens parameter set to disclose
what TCP port the server configuration binds to.  And this is exactly
how you'd see the above ServerTokens footer.

I strongly think this is what's happening in Jay's situation with
Google.  However, I read his email about eBay/etc. having complexities
too, to which would require the same kind of analysis.

If there is a *transparent* proxy involved on the ISPs side, well then,
that makes things very very difficult to analyse.

Wow.  Yeah, right, are you not supposed to be under NAT on Sprint 4G, either?

I can neither confirm nor deny that we use stock Debian Lenny with PHP5.2.6
on the front end, so I'll just leave this here:

We are seeing a SIP outage with Verizon since about 10:45am MDT - none of 
the DIDs we have provisioned through Verizon are ringing through - fast busy 
or number not in service recording. We have a ticket open with Verizon and 
they also have a master ticket, although we do not have that number. Their 
update page says the tickets are 'being worked'....

PacWest Telecom has an inbound outage that they say began at approximately 1 am Pacific time today. I reported the outage at 5:15 am and was told there was a hardware failure overnight and that I would be switched to a different machine.

7:45 am and four phone calls later this remains down and no ETA is available.

It is very vague: could you produce at least a dig's output? We do not
know if you talk about their resolvers or about the authoritative name
servers for verizon.com.

verizon.com appears to works fine (served by Akamai DNS service).

Additionally, their main support number is playing the follow automated message:
"As of 15:27 PM, remediation cleared the events causing query failures to our authoritative DNS servers"

No reason given, and their support staff will not give out any answers other than there was a "domain outage".  So, there was something, but there is no reason as to what it was.

It is very vague: could you produce at least a dig's output? We do not know if you talk about their resolvers or about the authoritative name servers for verizon.com.

verizon.com appears to works fine (served by Akamai DNS service).

In response to our ticket about the fact that the DNS outage took out 
their SIP trunking towards customers:

**Verizon Customer,*

We had a complete outage for incoming SIP via Verizon this morning that they 
attributed to DNS issues. Their last email on our ticket with them on it said:

**Your ticket was cross-referenced to a higher-level outage ticket that

It seems to be working fine, I see traffic although there are some reports
of delays or messages flagged as spam.

 

You may also want to double check that the email address you are sending
from is subscribed:

 

https://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/voiceops

 

Also since outages and voice-ops are both on the same mailman server, they
should work about the same as each other.

Note for folks:

This is SOP (standard operating procedure) for Verizon.  You *will not*
be able to get a root cause or RFO from any tech/engineer/support person
you speak to.

If you want an RFO, you need to ask your Support Director (or Sales Rep
if you don't have such a person and you'll be appointed one).  You'll
need to give them a ticket number (doesn't matter if it's a masters
ticket or not) and give them about 2-3 weeks.  You'll get an official
RFO then.

Subject: [outages] Level 3 cable cuts in Europe (between UK/IE)
Message-ID: <20130419010822.GA41003@icarus.home.lan>

I'm being told there are 2 physical cable cuts affecting Level 3 in
Europe -- as of 2013/04/18 around 1020 UTC -- and are still presently
down.

The geographical endpoints of the cables I was given:

Whitesands**, UK          <--> Kilmore Quay, Ireland
Bude (north Cornwall), UK <--> Wexford, Ireland

I see nothing on NANOG that seems relevant, and would expect 2 cable
cuts to have some mention somewhere by now.

Curious if anyone has knowledge or information or visibility into this.

Thanks!

** -- This is all I could get, and it's still too vague because there
are 3 possible places this could match:

Whitesand Bay (in west Cornwall)
Whitsand Bay (in southeast Cornwall)
Whitesands Bay, (in Pembrokeshire, Wales)

 Recent Notes
 DateNotes 4/18/13 11:18:52 PM GMTThe EU Transport NOC advised that the
Segment A fault between Whitesands, United Kingdom and Kilmore Quay,
Ireland is located approximately 23 kilometers from Whitesands, United
Kingdom. Preparations for fiber repairs are ongoing for the Segment B fault
under Event Ticket 6497787 and the next update will be sent when new
information becomes available. 4/18/13 10:51:36 PM GMT The EU Transport NOC
reported that preparations for fiber repairs are ongoing at this time on
the Segment B cable failure. The EU Transport NOC also advised that the
cause for the fiber cuts cannot be determined at this time. Additionally,
as repairs will commence on the Segment B cable failure first, the
estimated repair time for the Segment B cable is Sunday, April 21st, and
upon completion the cable ship will travel to the Segment A fault location
to begin repairs thereafter. The estimated repair time for Segment A is
Wednesday April 24, 2013, and the EU Transport NOC informed that both
estimated repair times are contingent on weather conditions. As such,
further updates will be provided as new information becomes available. 4/18/13
1:30:00 PM GMTThe EU Transport NOC advise the cable ship commencing repairs
on the Segment B fiber failure is reporting to have enough cable and
supplies to also complete the Segment A repair between Whitesands, United
Kingdom and Kilmore Quay, Ireland. The current estimated repair time for
Segment B fiber is Sunday, April 21st. Upon completion of Segment B, the
cable ship will then transit to the Segment A fiber failure and commence
repairs thereafter. The EU Transport NOC report that repairs for the
Segment A cable are expected to be completed four days following Segment B
repairs weather permitting. As such, further updates will be provided as
additional information becomes available. 4/18/13 11:32:32 AM GMT EU
Transport NOC advised a suspected subsea fiber cable failure on Segment A
between Whitesands, U.K . and Kilmore Quay, Ireland, isolating all network
elements on Ireland. Due to a previous fiber failure on Segment B on the
subsea fiber cable last week, the Segment A fiber failure has affected both
protected and unprotected services as well as all telemetry to network
devices. Currently, a cable repair ship is on station for the Segment B
fiber failure, however, adverse weather and sea conditions have delay
immediate repair to the damaged cable. Preparations are underway for a
cable ship dispatch on the Segment A fiber failure.

Update: reported to he.net support@ on 18:34, including a follow-up phone call; 
everything's back online, as of at least 18:51 PT.  
Pretty fast resolution, for a free service. :-)

According to he.net, tserv wasn't responding on its IPv6 address, and has 
henceforth been rebooted.

Which adds up as per my mtr from a Linode:

And I guess ordns.he.net (2001:470:20::2) really runs on tserv

However, it's unclear why IPv6 connectivity of tserv1.fra1.he.net

Message-ID: <CAFG21oiS9XWVRBFFC1jiJkC7fmU5VGTKR6Q9myAKtot4wtU9dA@mail.gmail.com>

We have a colo in the El Segundo Savvis facility and as of about 30
minutes ago we started experiencing much reduced inbound traffic
(email) and outbound traffic (websites) and large packet loss.  Doing
a traceroute to yahoo, I see:

Hop 5 is Savvis, hop 7 is Level 3.  I do not know the geographical
location of those routers.  The master case number is 3877881, but I
can't view any details of that case from their portal (and they
"closed" mine that I created when they attached it to the master
case).  I know it's impacting the El Segundo and Orange County
facilities, not sure about Burbank or any other locations.

Is there something going on with either of these two (Savvis and/or
Level 3) at the moment that anybody is aware of in the SoCal area?
Details, we're looking for details.

Everything seems better as of about 5 minutes ago.  I have no idea
what was the problem.

Todd,

http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog47/presentations/Sunday/RAS_Traceroute_N47_Sun.pdf

1. Can you provide source and destination IPs?

2. Do you have a return path traceroute?  This is incredibly important.

3. Can you use a utility like mtr instead, from both endspoints?

4. Is there some reason your below traceroute is in some format that
looks almost hand-written and lacks any indication of packet loss (e.g.
no "*" indicators)?  It's not that I don't believe you, it's that the
evidence needs to be presented.

If you need a destination to reach (that hopefully utilises the network
path you're seeing problems with), you can use my box: 206.125.172.42.
I do not filter ICMP.  If you provide an answer to #1 I can provide
return-path results.

But in general, testing against a site where you don't have return-path
access/visibility makes troubleshooting very difficult.  See the PDF I
linked.  :-)

Traffic levels are back to normal.  On my way to pick up my kid from
school, Savvis called to verify the issue had been resolved.

I'll be more cognizant of these things, even when hair mode = fire.

> 1. Can you provide source and destination IPs?

nat'd src 208.89.136.20 to dst 98.139.183.24

I was in too much of a hurry.  You should be able to traceroute back
to 64.14.201.31 or 208.89.138.21.

> 3. Can you use a utility like mtr instead, from both endspoints?

Next time I'll go out and back from our rackspace machine in HK.
Obviously I would have to use something different as the remote since
my trace was to yahoo.com and I am not a yahoo employee.  I just
picked something different from my co-worker (he used google) to make
sure that in saying "the Internet is down", I wasn't just some idiot
if it was just "google is down".

Agreed.  I used tracepath (CentOS 6.x) instead of mtr or traceroute.
Again, too much of a hurry.

Thanks for the offer, but no need.  The master ticket has been
resolved, I'll know more technical details in 5 days or less.

Agreed.  Too much going on at once and didn't get all the info out I
should have.

Thanks for the reply Jeremy, it's much appreciated.

Message-ID: <CAJhsz8v_1BYZF1QqvnCHNqO4UD1MyBwOa4we13Ad7uKodzucSA@mail.gmail.com>

Level 3 released the following statement in response to a trouble ticket
for an outage on one of our circuits in Equinix Ashburn. Is anyone else
in/near NoVA being impacted by this?

"The fiber cut is located near Dranesville, VA and was caused by a
construction contractor, placing conduit for another fiber provider. The
outside plant manager advised that the damaged portion of fiber, has been
excavated. There is an efficient amount of slack, to make a splice. The
splice crew has an ETA of 1 hour. The next update will be sent, upon
arrival."

this started yesterday afternoon sometime and is still ongoing.

We're having issues with calls inbound/outbound in Indianapolis, 
Milwaukee, Tampa and Kansas City.  They seem to be mostly between 
Windstream and ATT numbers from what we can tell. Looks to be extremely 
wide spread though.

Starting last Thursday, we have been getting sporadic "number not in service" messages in the voice of Allison Smith (meaning ASTERISK server) when calling some TN's on Windstream (former PaeTec network).

We are seeing this across numerous carriers and the only thing we can find in common is Windstream.  We have a ticket open with our ULC now to try to find out what's going on.

Seeing multiple reports of problems calling NuVox/Windstream TNs in the SE or more.  Also the windstream.com website fails or is slow to load.  Seems this started yesterday afternoon sometime and is still ongoing.
