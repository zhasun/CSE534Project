Seeing a variable 10-30% packet loss on Comcast/XFinity Illinois area,
non-business line

I can ping/tracert hop 6 with 100% return over multiple attempts but get
packet loss on hop 7 and any targets past that.

Ping statistics for 98.139.183.24:
    Packets: Sent = 25, Received = 20, Lost = 5 (20% loss),

Looks like a fairly sizable fiber cut causing some problems. I don't
have many details, but I know that engineers are working on it.

 =============

For a short period this afternoon (EST, western CT), my TiVo box
could not access my account on the TiVo service.  I thought
little of it, as short-term (3 to 6 hour) outages are a frequent
occurrence (apprx. weekly or every other week) with the TiVo
service.

Was there a major DDoS attack just now against Dash? Calls were failing and
the ones that did connect had poor call quality.

Dude, Bandwidth doesn't need s DDoS attack to have QoS issues.   They just need it to be a day of the week that ends in "-day".

We saw problems with level3 as well.  I believe dash uses level3 upstream.

I'm seeing more than 50% of our connections with charter offline and
almost 100% in the eastern half of the US. Have been hold waiting for
a rep for over 40 minutes thus far. This is both Fiber and Cable
connections.

Anyone else seeing this or have any details? I know some of the areas
could be storm related but they all dropped at the same time and in
areas on both sides of the storm

Yes.  Atlanta metro area, no storms or bad weather.   Same outage occurred
7 days ago (Black Friday AM).

SYNC Timing Synchronization failure - Failed to acquire QAM/QPSK symbol
timing;;CM-MAC=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;CMTS-MAC=00:00:00:00:00

Note the CMTS MAC...imo thats indicative of a plant failure.

Doesn't seem like a plant issue... We are seeing this across the country
all at the same time.

No doubt.  I just expect to see a CMTS MAC if there is signal in the
plant.  Could be a multi-regional CMTS patch fu*kup.

Charter is coming back up in the Atlanta area.  7:15am here, probably
just took someone waking up and kicking something. :-)

Some things are coming back but I believe there are still a lot of issues.

Correction... Teammate shut down our BGP sessions after calling charter and being told they had "a global BGP issue" and they were manually adding BGP routes to their equipment (not sure what that means).

Our traffic and connectivity graphs indicate the problem started around 2am central. My teammate says his home charter internet service was out when he woke up this morning too.

I can confirm both the coax and fiber outages in Wausau,Wisconsin. Not
being with an ISP or having the fancy lookup tools some of you guys have,
our fiber appears to be back up.  We've had clients all over the state
rolling up/down beginning early this morning.

Is there any word if this is affecting voice services as well?

Thanks,

Anthony Hook

We're in Verona WI and we received a boatload of helpdesk tickets from our tech services staff members about connectivity problems getting to our customer sites, but zero tickets about any voice problems (Charter is our first-choice outgoing for long distance, which we do a ton of).  I'm thinking that we would've seen tickets about voice problems too if there were any.

As soon as we shutdown our Charter BGP sessions, connectivity to our customer sites was restored.

We went down hard for a while on our Charter connections (St. Louis area). Some things are coming back but I believe there are still a lot of issues.

Charter is coming back up in the Atlanta area.  7:15am here, probably
just took someone waking up and kicking something. :-)

In Appleton, WI we saw voice outages but our point to point ethernets 
stayed stable.  None of our p2p's extend out of the NE Wisconsin area, 
however.

Not sure if this helps or hinders the issue(s) presented:

One of our Charter connections (DOCSIS) never lost IP transit between
Cleveland, TN and Atlanta, Ga.

Circuit (VC) Originates on Charter IP Transit/Transport and arrives via
IP-Transit (non-private-peering) in Atlanta.

Happy to provide more information, if it's of use to someone while
investigating what appears to be a national outage/issue.

In the future, a source IP, destination IP (Google has more than one DNS
server), and traceroute would be useful.

One of our DNS servers just had incorrect data cached for google.com and
www.google.com:

dwhite at quark:~$ dig www.google.com

www.google.com.     24  IN  A   201.130.208.15

After the 24 second cache timeout, the correct (google space) IPs
populated:

I did not notice this on any other DNS servers.

Those are valid Google IPs, so this is likely working as intended and you
were just temporarily being load-balanced to a different datacenter.  If
you're still concerned, please send me more detail off-list.

If they are valid Google IPs then your rDNS could do with some updating...

I should have noted that during the time that www.google.com was resolving
to 201.130.208.x, access to google.com and youtube.com was unavailable
(timeouts within a browser).

Message-ID: <CAEgjJMQze56YYO8i_vFmkeJgUzK49sy7Jf34cX1jPB_F3v7Rvg@mail.gmail.com>

Not sure if this issue has been corrected and/or fully resolved, however,
we noted a massive outage with Hurricane Electric starting at 4PM Eastern.

Appears as though some BGP connections have re-established themselves for
about 25 minutes or so, however we have had a couple of other HE BGP
facilities bounce since. Also noted some odd routing that had taken place
on the exchange at exactly the same time.

It was a country-wide outage affecting all STE (Syrian
Telecommunications Establishment) networks which is 93% of all Syrian
prefixes.

The Only Syrian prefixes that were still reachable were 7 prefixes via
AS24814 ( Syrian Computer Society), connected via Turk Telecom AS2481

Services were restored (according to BGP data)  at 12:50 UTC after a 3h
20min outage.

We have four private T1's that have been down for coming up on 24 hours now.

AT&T tells us there is a large fiber cut and that over 400 fibers are in
need of repair.

The initial ETTR was around 10:00 AM ET, but that came and went. The new
ETTR is 4:00 PM ET.

Zaid:

 

Thanks.  I tried traceroutes points before and after the Level3 routers and
am not seeing that packet loss.  Is it possible the issue is only between
your network and Level3?  But I also checked from several Calfornia
locations on Level3's lookingglass to 199.101.162.229 and saw no packet loss
- if it's a LAG connection, it could be my testing is hitting the wrong LAG
member?

I saw the site down approx. 15 minutes ago, but it is back up for me now.

Note that the home page seems to be delivered via Akamai, so unless it's

I got a Level3 confirmation that there was an issue but fixed now. Still waiting on details but I don't see an issue now.

But I also checked from several Calfornia locations on Level3?s lookingglass to 199.101.162.229 and saw no packet loss ? if it?s a LAG connection, it could be my testing is hitting the wrong LAG member?

Tucows.com is UP and reachable.
The website is probably down just for you...

Works for me from my machine, too.

I tried from 3 different countries, several ISPs, and iidrn.com before 
reporting.

I also received reports of it being down from a hosting company we collocate, who resells OpenSRS. Apparently a DoS.

Subject: [outages] Sprint 4G LTE DNS intermittencies late at night
In-Reply-To: <18614855.958.1387328560017.JavaMail.root@benjamin.baylink.com>
Message-ID: <24052183.960.1387328844173.JavaMail.root@benjamin.baylink.com>

I have been noticing a *lot*, lately -- one day in three-ish -- that my
Sprint 4G phone will, for a lengthy but apparently random period between 0100
and 0300EST, lose the ability to resolve DNS names using the resolvers that
I am provided by Sprint.

I think I reported a version of this before, but hadn't nailed down quite
what was going on then.

I have since found the SetDNS app, and proved that during these outages --
during which FB and Twitter, frex, still worked, because they had internally
cached the relevant server IPs, but web browsing would not and neither would 
manual DNS lookup with testing tools -- if I used SetDNS to switch to, say,
openDNS, then everything immediately started working.

If I then disabled SetDNS and rebooted (cause there seems no way to get SetDNS
to reset the addresses it found), it immediately broke again.

So, is this poorly managed scheduled maintenance on *both* the resolvers
that Sprint hands me?

Or something else?

Anyone else with Sprint LTE (non-Spark) in the Tampa or other markets who
can confirm or deny?

Cheers,
-- jra

Hi Everyone,

Since no one has pointed it out yet, it looks like Verizon and Cogent has
packet loss on the east half of the US.  Automated performance testing from
keynote agents on Verizon connections for $DAYJOB sees this as well.

Unfortunately this has been going on for many months between Cogent and Cogent's peers. We had to engineer around cogent because anytime one of our users tried to use a VPN to us, it was unusable.  From what I have heard, this is a business not a technical issue and isn't going to be resolved anytime soon. There have been periods where the loss is less, but generally > 0.

Verizon -> Alter -> telia has issues.

We have seen this too, particularly through DFW.  Reports I get back 
from both sides agree with the "business issue" diagnosis.  As such we 
have moved all traffic toward Verizon away from Cogent links.

Tnx

Subject: [outages] odd gmail issue.. inet6 ?
Message-ID: <52B59E23.6070800@sentex.net>

I noticed on a couple of our mail servers, delivery to gmail was getting
stuck in the outbound queue.  Our MTAs are all sendmail

If I hardcode delivery to gmail to 74.125.142.26 via a mailertable
entry, mail goes through fine

But if let it naturally select the inet6 addr, it hangs

print out the contents...

Of course, 2 min after sending this the problem goes away and mail flows
once again :(

For the archives, I should have know this, but to get sendmail to spit
out a little more of the exchange, a -d17 would have done the trick.

eg  sendmail -q -qRdestuser at gmail.com -v -d17

My residential internet on Comcast started having high ping times and
packet loss to the internet.   I rebooted my router, and now i have native
IPv6 only.  I can not access IPv4 addresses.  Can anyone else in the Bay

Hey Grant.

I'm on Comcast up just fine on San Carlos, but my friend from up the street is down here now; issues with his comcast connect at home. His IP is in 24/8. I'm in 50.152.135/24. (it's been this way for 1+ year) He can ping his place 20ms from mine, but at the moment, nothing else.

Interesting... I am in Mountain View as well and only have native v6.  No v4 still.

The issue just recovered on its own.
Thanks to those who replied!

Message-ID: <52BDCF77.6090102@garlic.com>

Seems like some Megapath/Covad DNS servers are non-responsive:

64.105.172.26
64.105.172.27

We have dozens of end-users down that utilize these, so they are
effectively down.  Anyone from Megapth/Covad alive today?

Thanks,

Passing along the good word from /r/networking

"For anyone in the southwest US (specifically anything that goes through
southern California, ATT is experiencing an "over saturation" on their
network.
It appears to be affecting every handoff in the area.
Problem nodes: 12.122.x.x
Symptoms include dropped packets and 400+ms latency.
Internap, Cogent, and Level3 have confirmed tickets opened with ATT NOC.
Update: ATT reports it as a DDoS attack that is causing the issue. They are
working to mitigate."

http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1u12y9/att_over_saturation_report/

I'm outside the affected area so I don't have anything technical to add and
wasn't sure if appropriate for me to notify the list.

We were told by our provider that it was a Ddos as well.  They said it was
mitigated as of about thirty minutes ago.

Update: Internap is reporting that they are seeing traffic levels normalize. My tests confirm.

Cogent is still experiencing issues with this (average latency 452ms on trace run 1 minute ago).

Same with Level3 and XO Communications.

My internal testing doesn't show that.

I just received word from Internap that they are the target of a DDoS as well. I'm still seeing the same symptoms as reported across all of my upstream providers that hit the ATT network.

We were told by our provider that it was a Ddos as well.  They said it was mitigated as of about thirty minutes ago.

Message-ID: <7D1B71C4CB3D0040A553783182CAB5795B6B4B@CLE-EX-MBX1.telsource.net>

Our circuit is through AT&T, but the LEC is Windstream.

"Outage associated with the ATT CNOC Network Advisory for multiple T3 facility failures out of Valley, WI. ATT T3 Group investigated and notified outage to Windstream for further investigation. Per the ATT T3 Group, Windstream restore service and the affected T3 facilities.

More details from the linked T3 ticket...Windstream outage affected 193 DS3s in the Wisconsin area.

An OC192 affected and, wait for it............Windstream two outages, a kinked fiber in Dousman, WI, and, fiber cut between Platteville and Wisconsin River (Millville), WI.

The OC192 issue related to the kinked fiber in Dousman, WI. The fiber cut between Platteville and Wisconsin River (Millville), WI, still ongoing."

Ouch.  That'll be down for a while.

Anyone seeing issues with HostGator?  It appears that they may be having serious problems affecting client servers and even the HostGator phones to find out more.

Frank,

I was just looking into this too as we had a monitor trip on a hosted 
domain here who also has DNS at bluehost. It looks like there main site 
is also down. (or maybe just not resolving) 
http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/BLUEHOST.COM also shows it down.

Yes -- it appears that whatever services Bluehost.com (and the others
mentioned in other threads) hosts, is out of service.

My DNS is externally hosted but my websites hosted on bluehost is returning
a blank page.  Not sure if this is related.

I'm being told that "I think it's coming back up".

They must not just be collocated, but share some of the same network infrastructure.

Interesting to note that the umbrella company lists out the main brands with links to each:

That's because the company moved HostGator into the Bluehost DC in Provo.

Thanks.  There's more than one tweet that suggests it's a data center issue that's affecting both Bluehost and Gator.

Just in case my ASSP modification to the subject caused a rejection....

Frank,

I confirmed with some mates of mine that still work at Bluehost. They're saying it's not just outside DNS that is failing. VPN, etc., is down as well.

We have one customer whose domain is on Bluehost and we can't find their MX record.  The two DNS servers, ns1.bluehost.com and ns2.bluehost.com, are not responding on TCP port 53.  

Twitter jabber confirms an issue.

Frank
