Subject: [outages] Issues with Earthlink/STS in Florida
Message-ID: <CA+TKNNadzNAf+vaAyTB5_HWMpvTDFBzZ+20xHXH9HcpS2kPd6g@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone know what the issues are with Earthlink/STS in Florida? I have
multiple circuits down, and the only info I've been able to get out of
Earthlink is that "hundreds of customers" have been affected and they have
no ETR. I haven't been able to get a master ticket number or a conference
bridge number out of anyone.  I just was on hold for over 30 minutes trying
to get a hold of someone to talk to.

This is affecting both my legacy and data circuits.

Thanks folks, and sorry for the noise.

-Eric

Banks, CUs, over 100 targets.

Or maybe this is a reverse Diabolique.

Seems to be affecting DSL, T1 on our end, and from what you've said
ethernet as well.

Have a number of customer DSL sites down as well, southern US. Help Desk is telling me they can't get a ticket number from CL for this -- anyone have a master ticket from CL?

Been down and out for the count here in Kansas City on AS22186 (Legacy 
Embarq/Sprint) / 76.7.0.0/19 since around 3AM central time. The routing 
within CenturyLinks' network still appears to be functional (DSL 
customers), but anything outside of a local region with CenturyLink 
appears to not function.

Unfortunately, I've not much more to say than that. =/

Regards,
Brett

If you operate a DNS server, or are a network operator, you should check your IP space for Open Resolvers.  These are used in DDoS attacks and pose a significant risk to the global network.

Sounds like it was scheduled maintenance gone bad:
	"Perrine said he spoke with CenturyLink at 6 a.m. 
	where they advised him the company was doing scheduled
	maintenance. At 7:35 a.m. they told him something
	had gone wrong during the maintenance and it was
	affecting customers in 13 states."

I bite my tongue in regards to Network Tallahasee's singlehomedness and
Perrine's comment on his questioning of the timing of the update. 

I encourage all my competitors to stay single homed and to do their
maintenance Sunday morning, while their vendors are at their lowest staffing
levels.

I first saw timeouts with www.qwest.com over IPv6 at 3:08 am Central -- I
was wondering why, now I know. =)

Saw our Centurylink Ethernet circuit lose L3 connectivity in SWFL around
0400 EDT. 
ANS/ABS states it's a nationwide routing issue. No ETR.

All of our IP space is routing again, as of 11:57 EDT , in SWFL. Seeing
reports of local DSL connections back up as well.

Same thing happened in Monroe LA that took down all of north Louisiana. It
was an update that went bad and the switch had to be manually checked line
by line. No backup was done before the maintenance. 16 hours of downtime
about 45 days ago.

 Sorry to everyone, I should have had more info for you from the start.

The locations that we were getting reports from seam to be mostly on the
east coast (Virginia, New Jersey, New York).  This was not a complete
internet outage for them, it seams that there was a route that was down
somewhere in between them and us in Walla Walla, Washington.  As of right
now everyone has reported back saying that the issue has been resolved. I
would post some trace routes but they are all going through now.

Again sorry for the lack of information on my first post.

 I have Verizon DSL to my house and I can see it (Wisconsin).

While going over some of our BGP data I noticed significant instability
for AS5668 CenturyTel Internet Holdings, Inc.
See for example:

Clearly visible are the routes flapping (few minute outages) between
08:06 UTC and 15:34.

Thanks for sharing that info.  That lines up with us seeing HTTPv6 alarms
clearing at 10:31 am Central, too.

Anonymous had issued a warning to attack a large number of banks today?
Not sure if this could be related.  I haven't heard of any of my Banks
being attacked as of yet.

It's seems Frontier Communications home page has been down over IPv4 and
IPv6 since 12:34 pm Central.  Port 80 is open over v4 and v6, just the page
doesn't load.

I'm seeing intermittent behaviour -- sometimes it works, sometimes it
doesn't.

"Doesn't" means HTTP headers get returned, but actual content does not,
despite Content-Length saying so.  The TCP socket gets abruptly closed
before actual content can be returned.  Proof:

$ curl -i -I -s -v http://www.frontier.com/
* About to connect() to www.frontier.com port 80 (#0)
*   Trying 66.133.172.205...
* connected

I would say this is a webserver/host problem on Frontier's side.  Maybe
someone should introduce them to IIS's /REBOOTONERROR flag.  ;-)

We are having LD connection issues from our PRIs in the Tampa Bay area. 
Local calling seems to be OK, but LD calls hit dead air.

I've had major network connectivity issues with about 10 to 15% of my
instances in zone "A" at Amazon's US-EAST-1 region this morning.

The instances are trucking away, but the networking is
down/flapping/unreliable like crazy on that minority percentage.

Anyone else seeing anything like this?

That status board doesn't show any problems (http://status.aws.amazon.com/).
 Keep in mind that the zone letters differ between accounts so zone A for
you could be zone C for someone else.

Currently connected to an instance in us-east-1 with a PPTP VPN endpoint
running on the instance, no problems.

I'd provide the availability zone, but my understanding is that they don't
correlate across AWS accounts.

Hi Blair,

I am not observing any issues in US East.
FYI your 1a, may not be 1a for others.

Not seeing anything like this at this time and I have instances in ALL EAST AZ?s.

However, it?s quite common to see networking hiccoughs on some instances in an AZ that mysteriously come and go lasting from seconds to tens of minutes..

It's not Amazon. There are large internet instability issues this morning affecting NTT, XO, Verizon, Level 3, and Cogent. Everyone is suffering a little today.

Right.  And I have a question about that.  To wit:

When AWS posts outages, like the one around this time last year that
affected to AZs, they named them by letter (b and d if memory serves).  But
I was viewing that page from a friend's computer who doesn't use AWS, and I
wasn't signed in.  So how do we know which "B" is "B" and which "D" is "D"
when they give AZ outage reports?

Anyone have any insight into this?

Good Morning!

Any other providers seeing any outages with Charter Communications? We have
a significant portion of our Charter originated customer base that can't
reach our cloud network/datacenter/pops nationally.

Doesn't appear as though any of our clients, specifically tested in the
Cleveland, TN region have internet access and all of the toll-free numbers
are currently ringing busy.

Our customers are also reporting that their online portals are stating
"Session Expired - please re-authenticate" and "Charter eOnline is
currently unavailable. We are working to restore access. You may try again
later or if you would like to make a payment now, click here to chat with a
live Agent or call 1-888-438-2427. We appreciate your patience.", in a
vicious cycle...With, again, that specific toll-free number responding with
a busy signal and the live Agent chat application not loading at any
customer's sites from alternate internet connections...

Kindly,

Kraig Beahn

This just happened again:  all IPv6 tunnels on tserv1.fra1.he.net.
were inaccessible; from within a tunnel, cannot access any IPv6
resource, other than ordns.he.net, which runs on the tunnel server
itself.

Why does FRA1 loses IPv6 connectivity so often?

Update: Seems like it has been resolved as I've been writing this
email, but this would seem to happen a few times too many.

Subject: [outages] IPv6 tunnels in FRA1 on HE.net down?

For what it is worth, further details about the issue have surfaced.
I found a friend who also has a tunnel on tserv1.fra1.he.net., and he
has been running smokeping to various IPv4 and IPv6 resources for
quite a while.

According to several of his smokeping reports, it can be concluded
that this very outage occurred during 14T18:00/05 and 14T18:45/50; but
we've also noticed that there was another, 6 hour (yes, 6 hour) outage
a day earlier, ~13T12 to ~13T18 (which corresponds to Monday early to
late morning Pacific Time).

I've contacted he.net again this time around, and they said that
they're trying to hunt some obscure kernel bug that is causing these
issues.

The tunnelbroker.net is a free service, but to have a 6 hour outage,
clearly spanning 1/4th of a whole day, is absolutely ridiculous.  I'm
stunned that IPv6 connectivity of tserv1.fra1.he.net. is, apparently,
still not monitored, even though it's known to be having these issues.
 ???

Alternatively, it is, of course, possible that some engineer has been
troubleshooting the root cause of this issue for those whole 5 or 6
hours on Sunday/Monday night; but I find that somewhat hard to
believe; more like it got busted, and noone responsible knew about it
being busted for most of the time that it was.

Even more troubling, is that they don't even publish any reports about
these extended outages.

For tserv1.fra1.he.net. end users:  if you can `ping6 ordns.he.net`
(it runs on tserv itself, try $(host `dig +short -6 @ordns.he.net
whoami.akamai.net`)), but cannot `ping6 ns4.he.net`, then it most
likely means that tserv1.fra1.he.net IPv6-connectivity is down again,
and you must open a ticket with HE.net ASAP.  Perhaps someone should
setup a smokeping with automatic emails to support at he.net?

Subject: [outages] WorldNIC/Network Solutions DNS or network issues?
Message-ID: <20130516045039.GA50648@icarus.home.lan>

Came across this one right now (21:48 PDT (UTC-0700)) while trying to
look up some tracking information on an Ontrac package I have.  Ontrac
uses WorldNIC/Netsol as their authoritative nameservers.

I wasn't able to resolve www.ontrac.com from my Comcast connection at
home (Mountain View, CA), while I saw intermittent DNS failures when
trying to do resolution from my VPS (Sylmar, CA), so I poked at things a
bit.  First from my VPS:

$ host www.ontrac.com
www.ontrac.com has address 12.38.237.1
Host www.ontrac.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)

And now from home:

$ host www.ontrac.com

Obviously I don't have return path traces.

I repeated the digs from my VPS, and they work but only intermittently.
So I'm guessing some kind of GSLB or network interface round-robining
may be impacting things, but only via some routes/paths.

Sorry if I've forgotten some information or a step, doing too many
things at once right now... :-)

This seems to have resolved itself in some manner of speaking; things
this morning seem fine.

Also, I embarrassingly made an octet typo when testing against one of
the nameservers (205 != 206); I have a tendency to type things in
manually rather than copy-paste (old habits die hard):

Can I ask what your post has to do with my thread about Netsol?  You
chose to "Reply" to my thread + change the Subject, thinking it would
start an new thread.  With many (most) mail clients, it doesn't -- note
the In-Reply-To: header:

TL;DR -- in the future, please be sure to actually start a brand new
Email and not reply to an existing thread + change the Subject.  :-)

Can I ask what your post has to do with my thread about Netsol? You 
chose to "Reply" to my thread + change the Subject, thinking it would 
start an new thread. With many (most) mail clients, it doesn't -- note 
the In-Reply-To: header:

TL;DR -- in the future, please be sure to actually start a brand new 
Email and not reply to an existing thread + change the Subject. :-)

Looks like a Comcast Interconnect issue.  Out of Chicago, seeing Outages 
to a Comcast circuit in Atlantic City via Telia (at a Chicago handoff), 
but Fine to Dekalb, Il, via Global crossing, and Northern Indiana via 
savvis.

I heard that there was a 288-count fiber cut this afternoon thanks to a
Fedex truck in Chicago. That might be related, but I'm not sure. I don't
have any more details than that, unfortunately.

I have no explanation how they could possibly be down for more than a day, 
even if only on IPv6; perhaps only he.net is affected?

li16x-xxx:~# telnet www.facebook.com http
Trying 2a03:2880:2050:1f01:face:b00c:0:9...
Connected to star.c10r.facebook.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
^CConnection closed by foreign host.
li16x-xxx:~# telnet fb.me http
Trying 2a03:2880:2110:df01:face:b00c:0:8...
^C

So, this is only fb.me that's affected, not www.facebook.com.
Doubtful that only he.net customers are affected, probably a
world-wide issue.

Seems ICMP traceroute should work to them, at least for IPv4.

I can try from another destination if needed.

Can you determine if this is a IPv6 vs. IPv4 thing?

Works fine over v4, just fails on v6.  I connect to the same IPv6 address.

I have no explanation how they could possibly be down for more than a day, 
even if only on IPv6; perhaps only he.net is affected?

Obviously IPv6.  And it's still down.

Dunno about you, but my non-happy-eyeballs browser takes a couple of
minutes before an fb.me link completes.  I vaguely recall the same
issue yesterday, which, if true, would be quite amusing for a site so
prevalent to be down for so long. :-)

Since becoming IPv6-enabled, this is by far not the first site that's
stopped working at some point in time for me, due to my browser being
IPv6-aware.

People talk about publishers not turning on IPv6 for their domains,
since there are misconfigured clients; I'd say IPv6 clients face a
bigger problem, in the face of so many misconfigured servers.

And fb.me is still down, BTW.

Message-ID: <5C1127AFC131744CB776088031C130A31136A8FAFA@cwexch>

Never thought I'd post here, but we have a gige via telus and get
transit through it via Shaw.

The circuit went down about noon PDT today and have not been able to
get much info except for a master ticket number. There have been very
little news coming out of Telus as this point.

Does anyone have info about an outage affecting, from the sounds of it,
a fairly significant outage for Telus in this part of the province.

We do have a second gige with Telus directly and that has taken the traffic
so I guess we have some diversity within telus for that one to remain up.

Thanks,
Keith

I use twitter, and people use fb.me links on twitter, which didn't work.

Heh, finally someone must have noticed, and instead of fixing it for
IPv6, they've just removed the AAAA record:

li16x-xxx:~# telnet fb.me http
Trying 173.252.110.27...
Connected to fb.me.
Escape character is '^]'.
^CConnection closed by foreign host.
li16x-xxx:~# telnet -6 fb.me http
telnet: could not resolve fb.me/http: Name or service not known

But it's still amusing that it's been down for so long.  I wonder how
many hours (or possibly even days) it's been down for. :-)

Wait, a site that's dedicated to sharing your life isn't privacy oriented?
You don't say.

Actually, my own reason for not joining facebook is that, back in the
day, they seemed to have required a registration to use any portion of
the site whatsoever, and I didn't want to impose such contagious and
exclusive conditions onto the people I want to share my content with.

Their privacy problems come from having been providing too much
privacy to start with (for whichever reasons), and then gradually
reducing said privacy (as market conditions and priorities or
philosophies have changed).

Not trying to rain on anyone's parade (honest!), but: could you guys
move this over to outages-discussion ?  That list is better-suited for
where this conversation is going.

Message-ID: <CDF0327C-C9F9-4343-938C-3DEFD4FEF7B7@oneiricsys.com>

Clients with domains registered at Network Solutions are reporting their sites are inaccessible. The issue looks to be related to worldnic.com DNS services.

http://dnscheck.pingdom.com/ shows the following errors:

* Delegation not found at parent:
	No delegation could be found at the parent, making your zone unreachable from the Internet
* Not enough nameserver information was found to test the zone www.<domain>.com, but an IP address lookup succeeded in spite of that.

The issue looks to be resolved now, but did anyone here notice similar issues?

Thanks,

I saw something similar to this on May 15th, and it started roughly
around the same time as your mail tonight.  See my list post:

https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2013-May/005561.html

The issue was gone by morning.

https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2013-May/005562.html

I would not be surprised if this was some kind of Netsol maintenance
that they just don't bother announcing.

I have seen several emails this week. You must have a blockage somewhere on your end :)

Ok something is wrong but you can check to see that emails have been sent (and received here) using the archives.

Here is ONE example.



https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2013-May/005586.html



AND there is no need to send test emails to any email list that has an open archive :)

The NANOG list also maintains a wiki, and on that site is a list of
people with datacenter experience whom you might use as Remote Hands if
you have an outage in a place where you don't have people.

If you find yourself in that situation, the list is here:

and there is, of course, other interesting material on the site as well; 
NANOG 55 is coming up shortly in New Orleans.

Subject: [outages] Chronic packet loss/latency in LAX (4 providers potentially involved)
Message-ID: <20130528025335.GA55018@icarus.home.lan>

Hi folks,

For the past 3-4 weeks (likely longer), there has been a peering point
in Los Angeles that has been repeatedly overtaxed every night for
roughly 5-6 hours.  Specifically high latency and packet loss.

It tends to start at roughly the same time every day (1800 PDT), and
tends to dissipate around the same time as well (2300 PDT or so) -- i.e.
prime-time.  This is not ICMP prioritisation -- this is real packet loss
(I can tell via SSH, fetching mail (IMAP), etc.).  However in recent
days (past week or so), the issue has persisted even until hours as late
as 0100 PDT, and today (for example) has existed since as early as 1500
PDT.  So the situation as I said is getting worse.

Because of asymmetrical routing, it's impossible for me to tell where
peering-wise the actual issue is:

a) between Comcast and GTT/nLayer
b) between Comcast and Tata/AS6453
c) between NTT/Verio and Tata/AS6453

Of those 4 providers I've only a relationship with one; me getting all
four to talk simultaneously, while the issue is happening, is virtually
impossible.  However it happens every night like clockwork, for a long
period of time, so resolution shouldn't be all that difficult.

I do periodic mtrs (think traceroute + ping combined) between my home
connection and my VPS.  Probe durations are 40 seconds, at intervals of
60 seconds.  I store roughly 2-3 months of data, and I can make all this
data available.

Here's examples taken from tonight, both directions.  Source and

If relevant providers are on this list and can respond, that would
be awesome.  If they can't respond but can instead start the ball
rolling on rectifying this, I think myself and many other 'netizens
would really appreciate it.

Oh yes, I've been seeing this for some time, probably since mid-April.

At times we've seen Comcast prepending their AS multiple times on 
announcements through Level3, causing outbound to Comcast traffic 
via congested routes with Tata, rather than what would otherwise be the 
shorter, uncongested route via Level3. (Return traffic from Comcast in my 
case returns via Level3.)

For traffic from a server in San Francisco connected via Level3 and XO, 
connecting to two Comcast cable modems in San Francisco, I see traffic go 
out via XO, Tata, Comcast via LA, with what looks like major congestion, 
then back up to SF.  With the appearance of major congestion on the 
Tata<->Comcast link.

I don't have any traffic which visiblity traverses NTT or nLayer, so I 
couldn't say if the scope goes beyond the Tata-Comcast link.

It's particularly annoying receiving LA latency + 5-6% packet loss going 
to/from well connected locations a couple miles apart in SF. I'm 
experiencing it now composing this message over ssh.

The ComcastSF -> ServerInSF goes out via Level3 and sees no loss until 
the final hop, suggesting the problem is with the reverse path, above. 
(Most of the time, sometimes the first Comcast hops going out are very 
congested too, though that's not usually the case).

And here's two smokepings of the issue, in which you can clearly see the 
timing of the issue you mentioned. SF server to SF cable modem, 2mi apart.

I don't think the issue is limited to just the providers listed.

Over the last several days we have been getting reports of long load 
times of sites hosted with us in Washington State. One specific customer 
is Just north of SF and is a comcast customer. Here is a traceroute from 
here before we worked with one of our upsteams today to route around 
cogent and currently the traffic is going over level 3 and it is better. 
I also had taken down that provider Last night for a while and Comcast 
took the traffic up to Seattle to my other provider were it was handed 
off. That link also worked very well. However Comcast to Cogent in 
Southern CA seems to be having issues best I can tell.

Sorry I don't think I have a MTR feed. I don't think any of my techs 
saved one yet going from us back down to my customers location.

Also i took out the beginning and ending of this for privacy. But the 
bulk of the traceroute is here. I find the hope from 68.86.87.6 to 
154.54.11.109 interesting in that is seems like there seems to be a good 
jump in latency there.

I hope this info is helpful. I have more data I can provide. Been trying

This isn't surprising at all. Comcast is notorious for running their
links into the ground.

The Comcast<->TATA links have been congested for a while now. Some
graphs from late 2010:

Pretty sure they do this so content providers have no other choice but
to pay them...

Adding to the collective troubleshooting below (which mirrors my
recent observations), I'd offer Tata being congested to various
US-based peers as an additional "x factor".  That is to say, even if
Tata-Comcast isn't congested in a given market, there is a possibility
that Tata-[provider x] might be.

Hot" is popular listening music for capacity planning sessions.

Subject: [outages] Chronic packet loss/latency in LAX (4 providers potentially involved)
In-Reply-To: <20130528025335.GA55018@icarus.home.lan>
References: <20130528025335.GA55018@icarus.home.lan>
Message-ID: <20130529014208.GA84272@icarus.home.lan>

A follow-up to this:

I received *many* off-list mails about this, but nothing official.  Lots
of (justified) speculation about which peering points and/or providers
it is, to which I did respond to some, but nothing conclusive.

Without going into details (respecting folks' privacy), I can say that
the NTT/Verio<->Tata peering point has been ruled out as the cause.

I should also note that the ingress path (Comcast-->ARP) has changed due
to what appears to be some peering adjustments done by Comcast last
night (specifically May 27th at 23:22 PDT or thereabouts).

This will be obvious below in a pair of live mtrs done by me manually,
with DNS resolution enabled.  (Someone off-list asked for this)

My gut feeling right now is that the issue is at the Comcast<->Tata
peering point (hops #5 and #6 in the 2nd mtr), or a Comcast router at
One Wilshire is overwhelmed (hop #6 in the 2nd mtr).

The reason I'm wanting to rule out ingress (Comcast->ARP) is because the
path today looks different than it did yesterday (Comcast<->GTT/nLayer
is no longer involved) yet the issue remains, thus something on the
return path looks more likely.

Anyway, here are the mtrs, taken about 10 minutes ago:

Maybe I haven't had my full coffee allocation for the day but I'm not 
understanding what you are requesting to be unsubscribed.

I'm not an admin but just curious what you are asking for.

I suspect someone left qwest and your getting bounces due to their still being subscribed.
Since you wanted the admin's to look at it I am cc'ing the owner.

I can't see the list of subscribers to validate this theory but there have been other occurrences of this same issue as far back as 2010 at least.
Even if I COULD see the subscribers I couldn't unsubscribe someone without their password.
And I am not volunteering to manage this list;)



Virendra Rode appears to be the list owner but the owner alias cc'ed above should reach him:)

It seems permanently down.


Maybe I haven't had my full coffee allocation for the day but I'm not understanding what you are requesting to be unsubscribed. 

I'm not an admin but just curious what you are asking for.

Boy, what a day. So I just saw some strange routes die. I am connected to a time warner cable connection and I guess from my side I can't get around anything that is in the Chicago area.

My route times out at 66.109.6.206 at ae-6-0.cr0.Chi30.tbone.rr.com And I can't even get to google.com Anyone else seeing this issue?

Message-ID: <CA+TKNNbf=GNcR=f6YzV5GHA9i7tOzmRi2CB3EuKEsJjt7QvvwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Earthlink/STS apparently had a VLX2020 fail last night in south Florida.

No ETR, but have been told it's a major outage, and when I pressed for an
ETR I was told they'd get back to me.

I showed it went down last night around 20:15 Eastern Time, and it kind of
came back up at 8:13 Eastern, but I've been told to expect it to bounce
until it's resolved.

Not sure if anyone else is affected by this, but figuring it's a VLX2020,
I'm sure there are.  If anyone else who has been affected by this outage
and the one on 5-6-13 can give me a jingle, let me know.  Trying to figure
out if we can coordinate DR plans or something here.

Thanks folks,

-Eric

The VLX2020 is White Rock gear (purchased by Turin who merged with Force10),
and is End of Sale and I'm not sure if Turin is supporting it anymore.

 

A neighboring network is migrating off of it now, as they've been plagued
with issues over the years.

A list sub was an employee who left Qwest, and they set his address to
bounce, using a bouncer that didn't say who he was.  All posters to the
list got that direct bounce, so we were trying to clean it up, and now
we have.

They are reporting that some folks have  been restored, up to 1hr for the rest of us.  Fremont router died.

Thanks.  By the time you checked it was already back up.  Outage time was
about 35 to 40 minutes.

 

A contact offline confirmed that ipv6.cablelabs.com was singlehomed (in
terms of IPv6) to HE, so that explains the concurrence of events.  

 

I suspect HE had an internal issue.
