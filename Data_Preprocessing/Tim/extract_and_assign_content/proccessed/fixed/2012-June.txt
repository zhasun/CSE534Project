Seems like their upstream cut them off. Their first NS and their website are in the same subnet, neither are reachable. This website has the public list of known IPs to block due to excessive login attempts and whatnot. We use it to build a db in our cpanel boxes (cphulkd) blacklist. http://www.openbl.org/lists/base.txt

I learned from our regional cellular provider at 5 pm Central that the
BlackBerry Network Operations Center received reports about no or sluggish
web browsing.  At 6:50 pm we were informed the issue cleared.

Did anyone see any issues around 11:14 EDT?  Had a BGP hold timer expire.
Not sure if this was a transport or router issue

I already sent an email to support at peeringdb.com<mailto:support at peeringdb.com> about this, but I'm uncertain they are receiving email properly, so I'll mention it here as well. I hadn't seen mention of it already anywhere.

I'm seeing MySQL errors when attempting to query peeringdb.com this morning. I'm assuming the admins or friends of admins lurk here. :)

IE:

Database error: Invalid SQL: .....<edited>

peeringdb needs better monitoring.  ;-)

The box that peeringDB is on is old and cranky. People are working on
moving it to a better box.


However, when the web interface goes down, usually you can still get

I assume this Dubuque, Iowa?  The only thing I've seen thus far is that at
11:25 am Central the wireless carrier we're associated with notified us of
an outage in Scales Mound, IL, which 30 miles east of Dubuque.  I'm not sure
if that cell site is fed out or through Dubuque, but considering the timing
and relative location, the two could be connected.

Update received from the wireless carrier while I was composing this
previous message:

	We've been notified of an issue w/ our customers calling to 
	CenturyLink customers in Dubuque:

	Calls to and from CenturyLink in the Dubuque area will likely 
	fail until this issue is resolved.  We are not seeing any 
	affected cell sites at this time. <redacted> went off the air at 
	around the same time, so it could be related.

	The NOC is working w/ CenturyLink to get this restored as quickly 
	as possible. CenturyLink has dispatched a tech to the site.

The redacted site (in addition to Scales Mound) is within 20 miles of
Dubuque.

Yes, Iowa. Sorry about that.
Sprint is telling us it is a fiber cut and DS3s to Clinton, IA are down.
But residential dialtone seems to be down and the 911 center has
rerouted calls to Cedar Falls. City is telling locals that 911 can be
reached via cell phones.

I learned more from the wireless carrier's NOC: CenturyLink's Dubuque switch
is isolated due to an OC-192 outage.

Already in the news:

Yes, Iowa. Sorry about that.
Sprint is telling us it is a fiber cut and DS3s to Clinton, IA are down.
But residential dialtone seems to be down and the 911 center has
rerouted calls to Cedar Falls. City is telling locals that 911 can be
reached via cell phones.

I assume this Dubuque, Iowa?  The only thing I've seen thus far is that
at
11:25 am Central the wireless carrier we're associated with notified us
of an outage in Scales Mound, IL, which 30 miles east of Dubuque.  I'm
not sure if that cell site is fed out or through Dubuque, but
considering the timing and relative location, the two could be
connected.

We lost voice and data circuits coming out of the Dubuque CO. Both
copper T1s and our Fiber node are down. I tried calling a few local
businesses in Dubuque and I get fast busy's. Nothing yet from my
carriers.
Anyone have any other information.

In-Reply-To: <17718381.9314.1339731792428.JavaMail.root@benjamin.baylink.com>

I'm having trouble getting their speedtest.net site to load tonight, from
Road Runner Tampa Bay, on three separate browsers on two separate laptops.

Same symptom: it gets to "Loading 100%", and then, on a netbook on FF13 or
Chrome, it hangs there; on my Linux ThinkPad, I get a red message saying 
something about the configuration file not loading - I can't give exact 
language cause now the session is resetting on me.  New problem in this 
location and with this ThinkPad; never seen this before.

speedtest.speakeasy.net works fine, but is much slower (1-2Mbps) than the
RR Lightning line here (40-50Mbps) would lead me to expect, testing to ATL.

Odd that that did work; this is starting to look like a last mile problem
at my end; I'm seeing lossage to lots of other sites, fading in and out.  Apologies for the noise.

I have the same problems, still.  In addition, I've had it complain
Flash Player wasn't of insufficient version.

On a side note even specifying a subdomain isn't getting past the red
configuration error, it's as if the embeded flash is broken.

Monitoring Twitter I'm seeing a lot of reports of various outages, so perhaps
this could simply be some global BGP re-convergence. Also seeing some Level3
routing issues and lots of route changes.

I think it's more than just last mile, I've been having horrible dropped
packets problems on BrightHouse cable near downtown St Petersburg for the
last hour, switched to my backup connection a little bit ago, still having
significant dropped packets(40%) when on roadrunner both here and at the
office 5 miles north of here through a different roadrunner connection.

--- google.com ping statistics ---
57 packets transmitted, 34 received, 40% packet loss, time 56109ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 52.397/54.663/77.355/4.163 ms

Is anyone else seeing issues processing payments through Elavon/VirtualMerchant? Their gateway is timing out when processing payments, can't process through merchant portal either.
All numbers we have for Elavon are ringing busy/disco. Anyone seeing similar?

It's a national outage... we use Elavon and all related sites are down.  Our
POS vendor has confirmed this is a national issue with no ETR.

It is time to fix those apps.

Hello,

Having multiple customers call in about reachability - common thread is 
their side users are all on Comcast.  Not to mention the fact that we 
can't even hit www.comcast.com from our network currently.

We have Level3 (Cincinnati) and Qwest (Chicago).  Traceroutes from us 
outbound seem to prefer Qwest and then die in Comcast.

I can post traceroutes if need be - just wanted to see if anyone knew 
anything before I call my upstreams and wade through phone tree hell.

I meant to say that I'm not aware of any outages, but I'm not on the
backbone team. I can take a look at the traceroute and get it to the
right people.

Their site comes up for me but Comcast is one of our direct peers (and
we are transiting them to reach their site). Our traffic levels on our
link to them appear normal for the past 24 hours too.

This is what I see from my Comcast edge router:

Hello,

Having multiple customers call in about reachability - common thread is 
their side users are all on Comcast.  Not to mention the fact that we 
can't even hit www.comcast.com from our network currently.

We have Level3 (Cincinnati) and Qwest (Chicago).  Traceroutes from us 
outbound seem to prefer Qwest and then die in Comcast.

I can post traceroutes if need be - just wanted to see if anyone knew 
anything before I call my upstreams and wade through phone tree hell.

I think it's Qwest in Chicago -> Comcast.  Looks like that's what Andy is 
using as well (edit: same router - chp-brdr-04.inet.qwest.net 
(67.14.8.234))   I think we are going to give Qwest a call.

Here's a before:

We have transit through AS209(Qwest/CL), AS701(VZ), and
AS7018(ATT).??  While AS7018 peers directly with Comcast, AS209
and AS701 are only  reachable from Comcast via TATA (formerly Teleglobe)
AS6453.
 
 We are unable to reach any of our prefixes that have
to transit AS6453.

 My strong suspicion at this time is that it's an issue with AS6453, or
at least the peering between AS7922 and AS6453.

Looks like we have connectivity again as of 14:08 CDT, although it looks
like Comcast/TATA peering is now shutdown in Chicago.

Traffic
is now routing through Ashburn, but with 15-20% packet loss.

Take the bad with the good, I guess.

Thanks for the update. Can you send me a trace of the path with packet loss?

It looks like www.justice.gov is down on IPv6.

This is likely causing some heart burn for dual stack network that
don't have happy eyeballs

If you know someone at DOJ, you may want to give them a heads up to
fix it (pull the AAAA DNS record until the servers are ready)

Thanks.  I check www.netflix.com via IPv6 and I saw the first issue at 10:13

Service Unavailable: Back-end server is at capacity".

The weather warning for the western end of Fairfax County this evening forecast gusts of up to 80 mph, out near Dulles. Dominion Virginia Power is currently stating that over half of their Northern Virginia customers are without power, and almost a third in the entire state. They're not even guessing at ETRs yet.

However, it does not seem to be a Java bug -- so far, it looks like
something is causing futex() to timeout, instead of telling the thread
to sleep [1], causing issues on anything that uses it (e.g., java,
chrome, mysql).

It's not clear exactly what variable (i.e., kernel versopm, distro)
causes boxes to go haywire. It may just be a race condition which some
people hit due to bad luck.

But it is certainly related to the leap second.

Looks like upgrading the JVM probably won't be the answer. Anyone know of a fix and/or workaround?

Yes, this seems to be the workaround:

/etc/init.d/ntp stop; date; date `date +"%m%d%H%M%C%y.%S"`; date;

Then restart the offending process. I think starting ntp back up is also fine.

FYI. We have restarted our applications multiple times and it seems to have no impact. We just go back to excessive load warnings.

Would have replied to a later message but none looked to be just perfect
so Ill reply here.

clock.nyc.he.net LOCAL(0)
clock.fmt.he.net LOCAL(0)
clock.sjc.he.net LOCAL(0)

All went to a LOCAL(0) refid sometime recently after being in .CDMA. for
the longest time.

Maybe this is a small part of it but thought I would share the note.
