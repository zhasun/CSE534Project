Not sure if anyone has anything to add, but figured I'd share this
with the list.

FYI.

Wild storms pounding the north western states of America have wiped out one
of Australia's major internet traffic routes to the US.

Southern Cross Cable operations vice president, Dean Veverka, has confirmed
that hurricane-strength storms and flooding have wiped out the carrier's
Oregon cable route and halved its bandwidth between Australian and the US.
Southern Cross's customers in Australia include iiNet, Internode and AAPT.

The cable had been severed between its Nedonna Beach and Hillsboro
facilities, Mr Veverka said. The company has a secondary cable that reaches
the US coast via Hawaii and California.

The outage has already begun hitting Australian internet providers. Greg
Bader , the chief technology officer with Perth-based internet provider
iiNet said it had already begun prioritising time-sensitive traffic to
manage the outage.

When storms washed out local phone networks up and down Oregon's coast
early Monday, some folks turned to their cell phones. Wireless service,
surely, could survive wind and water that blew down wires and washed out
cables.

Turns out, though, that even cellular carriers rely on cables to carry
their phone traffic from region to region. So the same floods that cut off
more than 20,000 phone lines from the outside world turned off many cell
phones, too.

Some coastal communities had phone service restored early Tuesday, but
calls still weren't getting through to areas of the north coast from
Astoria to at least Cannon Beach. Phone companies said they hoped to have
most service restored overnight.
