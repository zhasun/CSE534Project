Florida Power & Light said that a preliminary investigation has found that
human error was responsible for the massive power outage on Tuesday that
affected more than 584,000 customers.

A field engineer was diagnosing a switch that had malfunctioned at FPL?s
Flagami substation in west Miami. Without authorization, the engineer
disabled two levels of relay protection ? something contrary to the Juno
Beach-based company?s procedures.

During the diagnostic process, a fault occurred. With both levels of relay
protection removed, the outage affected 26 transmission lines and 38
substations.

One of the substations served three of the generation units at the
company?s Turkey Point nuclear plant, which was designed to automatically
shut down if there is a lack of enough power. Also affected were two other
generation plants in FPL?s system. The system lost 3,400 megawatts of
generating capacity.

Hi,

does anyone else see instabilities with Teleglobe in Amsterdam? I see
massive flapping of all paths through Teleglobe from several upstreams
(C&W and GBLX) and Tiscali seems to have shutdown the peering and going
through Equinix Ashburn now.

Started at about 8pm GMT yesterday evening.

Whenever I see one of these "the Intartubes are broke" things in 
Internet email, I am reminded of an event eons ago when I answered an 
alarm on a TJ Radio station (Microwave link) order wire to discover that 
it was the PBX repairman at the distant end announcing that pursuant to 
Circuit Order mumble he had shut down the station there.

I had to convince him that the order wire rode the radio link, and that 
the battery pack in the radio case would keep the station on the air for 
  quite a while after the plug had been pulled from the wall socket.

I was sitting down at the IETF yesterday, obviously bored. Then the 
wireless went down.

I was considering emailing to outages@
