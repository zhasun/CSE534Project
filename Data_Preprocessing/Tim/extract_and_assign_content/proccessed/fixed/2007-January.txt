Many thanks to Fergie for this link.


Via Yahoo! News (AFP).

Repairs to Asia's slow Internet, damaged by an earthquake that ripped
through key undersea data cables, have been postponed because of a major
fault on a ship sent to the fix the problem.

One of two repair ships that laid anchor in the Luzon Strait between Taiwan
and the Philippines above the damaged lines experienced a major fault
Saturday, Hong Kong's Office of the Telecommunications Authority said
Sunday.

The ship is now in Taiwan and will take about seven days to fix, the
authority said in a statement, pushing back the estimate for initial
repairs to one of the cable systems by a week.

Apparently a contractor punched a hole in the roof which caused water to
leak through the ceiling, causing power outages to one or two cages on

I think the Stevens Point outage is a separate incident:

	1.	They claim all services were restored by 5PM CST, but, our
		outage lasted until about 01:30 CST.

	2.	We were told that the utility pole in question was in California.

Dave,

[For IP, if of interest.]

I've been in southern China (Changsha, in Hunan province) since
Sunday (local time).  My observations have been that network
connectivity is significantly worse than usual, but is also
(unsurprisingly) somewhat time-of-day dependent. I have fairly good
success in the early morning; on the other hand, during evening hours
(local) it's difficult to connect with servers in the States. There
are also, of course, dependence on the particular services needed;
some Internet sites appear to be either better connected or have
services partly provided out of China, enhancing availability (Google
is a notable example of good perceived connectivity).  I also suspect
that the phenomenon includes increased network congestion due to a
much larger number of retries after failed attempts (to which I find
myself contributing, for example hitting the refresh button in hopes
of a better result).

We're hearing that services are up to the "70%" level (could be true,
could be PR) but that repairs have been delayed by a problem with a
repair ship and rough weather at sea.

Cheers,

Philip Lehman

Hi,

Does anyone have any news about an ATT outage lasting about 12-18 hours these last two days, which may have affected Yahoo DSL and ATT Citrix service? A company whose server we host started having problems yesterday -- they could apparently establish TCP connections to their server but upon trying to login, the session would simply timeout. It was as if the moment the client computer attempted to establish a second connection to the server with a new source port (but same destination port), the connection was denied. FTP was broken in the same way. Users could authenticate via FTP but were unable to transfer files. 

Company end-users all over the country were having the issue. We think they were connecting via Citrix to the main office in California, then trying to hop over the Internet to the server (located here in NY).

Sounds to me like some kind of firewall issue within ATT somehow.

Any news or insight welcome. 

Best regards,
Adam
