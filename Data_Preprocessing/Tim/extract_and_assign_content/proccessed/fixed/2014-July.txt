Looks like there are several locations that are out after the high winds.
 Few businesses on the COAX side are down but our fiber optic is running
well.  Anyone have anymore information on this?

Subject: [outages] Recent Verizon Issues
Message-ID: <CAEYw9YzDBv5c=EtRWbo2XiXXwi-mXEpoPH8Dme7F628eQy8QTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is anyone else experiencing issues with return traffic to the Verizon FIOS
network?

I've noticed that return traffic from our network destined for Verizon FIOS
customers either hits 0.xe-3-1-1-XL4.CHI13.ALTER.NET or
TenGigE0-2-0-1.GW5.CHI13.ALTER.net and dies off completely or continues on
through the Verizon network and experiences issues in the Dallas TX, Newark
NJ, or New York FIOS network portions.  I've attempted to route traffic out
different providers and this appears to alleviate the issues but I have
noticed the issue occasionally cropping back up and it appears to be at the
point where the other provider hands off to the Verizon network. I've
reached out to Verizon and they've been somewhat quiet with occasional
replies that they've identified a 'bad path" or replaced a "provider edge
card" on a device. I've recently received an influx of complaints with
Verizon FIOS support claiming no issues on their network and that it's
other networks experiencing issues.

Found a couple recent threads that appear to be experiencing similar issues.

Been seeing quite a few reports from customers mainly in Texas who are
having issues with TWTC clients.  Wonder if there is a general issue
with TWTC today.  Haven't seen anything confirmed as of yet.

Hi,

Is anyone seeing a partial outage of podcasts using iTunes on a Mac?

Several of my subscriptions have not updated since the day before
yesterday and the subscription shows an explanation point inside the
circle by the podcast name in list view. Running Wireshark and doing a
"refresh podcast" on those individual podcasts, I see a successful TLS
connection followed by a series of HTTP RSTs and the connection being
torn down. Examples of podcasts not updating include:
	*KQED's Forum	*NPR Topics: Technology Podcast	*60-Second Science  
(SciAm)	*Discovery    (BBC)
	My other dozen or so podcasts are updating normally.
Any ideas?

TIA!

JK

Few things (first two points might seem like I'm nitpicking but I just
want clarification):

1. What is an "HTTP RST"?  RST implies TCP RST, which is independent of
a layer 7 protocol like HTTP.  So are you saying you're seeing TCP RSTs
or are you saying you see something indecipherable (due to SSL use)
that causes the TCP connection to cleanly shut down?

2. I assume these are "standard HTTPS" connections (TCP port 443)?  I
ask because someone mentioning TLS when also mentioning HTTP (and not
use of the term HTTPS) makes me think of RFC 2817 (which allows a
plaintext HTTP 1.1 connection to be upgraded to TLS 1.1 still across
TCP port 80).

3. I believe Wireshark can do this (I'm more familiar with using openssl
s_client), but I would strongly suggest checking what the SSL
certificate is that the server returns.

It's very possible that the SSL cert the Apple servers use has expired
and the underlying client application lacks proper error handling /
display to handle this situation (e.g. popping up a UI telling the user
that the comm protocol failed due to SSL library errors, and displaying
that error result).  You might be surprised how often this happens
(companies not monitoring/tracking SSL cert expiry dates) -- it's
extremely common.

Sigh... Went back and tried pcap on a refresh several times, and got a

Jeremy, I will send you the small pcap off list if you don't mind, and

--As for the rest, it is mine.

Possibly relevant: Apple released a new version of the iTunes client 
yesterday, to support some back-end features.  (Movie extras - obviously 
not directly related, but it means there were changes on both ends 
yesterday.)

I reviewed the pcap.  I'm going to ignore the out-of-order complaints
because a NAT'd router is involved (not saying it's to blame though, it
could be upstream network stuff, Internet stuff, or close-to-server-side
stuff).  The important part is that it doesn't impact the end goal in
this case (figuring out SSL cert validity).  I will say that the
out-of-order stuff is a bit annoying in this case (especially right
before socket closure).

The certificate is in packet #13.  The cert consists of a two-stage
VeriSign CA plus the itunes.apple.com cert itself.  If you expand each
of those (signedCertificate -> validity) you'll see the dates printed in
YY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss format per UTC time.  The dates are as follows:

itunes.apple.com - expires 2016-04-20
VeriSign Class 3 Extended - expires 2016-11-07
VeriSign Class 3 Public - expires 2021-11-07

I also verified this via openssl s_client -connect itunes.apple.com:443
(see madboa.com for details).  So it's not an expired cert that's
causing this behaviour, and there's more to verify that:

In the same TCP session I was looking at ("tcp.stream eq 0",
communication between lanip:55217 and 23.72.242.217:443), packets 21
through 29 seem to indicate (to me) that there is an actual conversion
going on between client and server.  The segments are smaller than
MSS/MTU and there's no reassembly.  If I had to take a guess, it looks
like after cipher negotiation, the client submits its HTTP headers +
payload (packets 21-23), the server responds with some HTTP headers +
possibly a small payload (packet 25), followed by the server issuing a
TLS Encrypted Alert message (packet 27) which the client sends back
(packet 29), followed by the client sending FIN+ACK (30), the server
sending FIN+ACK (31), then out-of-order stuff gets in the way (32, but
its in reply to sequence 1854 which is packet 30), followed by the
server sending 3 TCP RSTs 0.043 seconds later (which may be normal for
SSL).

The oddity of the last bits of communication of session 0 made me look
at session 1 ("tcp.stream eq 1") which looks like a significantly more
clear communication/"things are working" up until a certain point where
I can tell the capture snaplen was probably too small (packet 71)
followed by a bunch of duplicate ACKs and retransmissions.

The behaviour in session 1 is indicative of some kind of network-level
anomaly.  I see things like the client repeatedly sending duplicate ACK
packets back to the server for ack seq 22480 but the server never sends
that / acts in some way like it did (but the client never got it).  This
sort of behaviour continues for quite some time, combined with further
TCP retransmits.  Like I said, this kind of behaviour seems to imply
some kind of network-level anomaly and possibly packet loss but I
couldn't tell you where.

The TCP aspect of things is anomalous enough to make me think the true
issue is at a lower layer.  If everything looked "mostly" as clean as
session 0 then I'd be more concerned with the payload that's being
encrypted (and that's the biggest problem with use of SSL: if there is
something application-level / layer 7 going on, you have virtually no
way of debugging it.  I often laugh at SSL for this reason -- great, you
have your security, good for you and the assumption that nothing will
ever go wrong + troubleshooting will never be needed other than at the
physical client application + physical server application layer).

Sorry I can't be of more help, but I can at least rule out server
certificate expiry as the root cause.  :-)

I can confirm I have also seen a few Podcasts experience the same thing, I have had to force download over and over until they finally complete.  I have not done any technical searching or captures yet.

I reviewed the pcap.  I'm going to ignore the out-of-order complaints
because a NAT'd router is involved (not saying it's to blame though, it
could be upstream network stuff, Internet stuff, or close-to-server-side
stuff).  The important part is that it doesn't impact the end goal in
this case (figuring out SSL cert validity).  I will say that the
out-of-order stuff is a bit annoying in this case (especially right
before socket closure).

The certificate is in packet #13.  The cert consists of a two-stage
VeriSign CA plus the itunes.apple.com cert itself.  If you expand each
of those (signedCertificate -> validity) you'll see the dates printed in
YY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss format per UTC time.  The dates are as follows:

itunes.apple.com - expires 2016-04-20
VeriSign Class 3 Extended - expires 2016-11-07
VeriSign Class 3 Public - expires 2021-11-07

I also verified this via openssl s_client -connect itunes.apple.com:443
(see madboa.com for details).  So it's not an expired cert that's
causing this behaviour, and there's more to verify that:

In the same TCP session I was looking at ("tcp.stream eq 0",
communication between lanip:55217 and 23.72.242.217:443), packets 21
through 29 seem to indicate (to me) that there is an actual conversion
going on between client and server.  The segments are smaller than
MSS/MTU and there's no reassembly.  If I had to take a guess, it looks
like after cipher negotiation, the client submits its HTTP headers +
payload (packets 21-23), the server responds with some HTTP headers +
possibly a small payload (packet 25), followed by the server issuing a
TLS Encrypted Alert message (packet 27) which the client sends back
(packet 29), followed by the client sending FIN+ACK (30), the server
sending FIN+ACK (31), then out-of-order stuff gets in the way (32, but
its in reply to sequence 1854 which is packet 30), followed by the
server sending 3 TCP RSTs 0.043 seconds later (which may be normal for
SSL).

The oddity of the last bits of communication of session 0 made me look
at session 1 ("tcp.stream eq 1") which looks like a significantly more
clear communication/"things are working" up until a certain point where
I can tell the capture snaplen was probably too small (packet 71)
followed by a bunch of duplicate ACKs and retransmissions.

The behaviour in session 1 is indicative of some kind of network-level
anomaly.  I see things like the client repeatedly sending duplicate ACK
packets back to the server for ack seq 22480 but the server never sends
that / acts in some way like it did (but the client never got it).  This
sort of behaviour continues for quite some time, combined with further
TCP retransmits.  Like I said, this kind of behaviour seems to imply
some kind of network-level anomaly and possibly packet loss but I
couldn't tell you where.

The TCP aspect of things is anomalous enough to make me think the true
issue is at a lower layer.  If everything looked "mostly" as clean as
session 0 then I'd be more concerned with the payload that's being
encrypted (and that's the biggest problem with use of SSL: if there is
something application-level / layer 7 going on, you have virtually no
way of debugging it.  I often laugh at SSL for this reason -- great, you
have your security, good for you and the assumption that nothing will
ever go wrong + troubleshooting will never be needed other than at the
physical client application + physical server application layer).

Sorry I can't be of more help, but I can at least rule out server
certificate expiry as the root cause.  :-)

Looks like our circuit came back up a few minutes ago.

We took a couple of brief hits on 2 1Gig DIAs out of Southfield, MI 
though - not sure if that was related.

Subject: [outages] AT&T SMS outage?
Message-ID: <!&!AAAAAAAAAAAYAAAAAAAAAFN+bXeiy2tHkjqcwxxSmQPCgAAAEAAAAGvic9FF9z9KmgTSrwntjFMBAAAAAA==@Streamline-Solutions.net>

Is anyone else experiencing an AT&T outage?  I have clients stating they
have not received any sms/text messages since 5pm last night all with aT&T
phones.

 

We have an AT&T SMS modem that seems to be working, at least to other
carriers.

 

Verizon phone is receiving texts, MetroPCS phones are receiving texts, but
AT&T phones are not

 

These symptoms are being seen in messages originating from the Tampa, FL
area
