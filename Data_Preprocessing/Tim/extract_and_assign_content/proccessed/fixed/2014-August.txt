Down for me on PC and working poorly on Android.  Same network on both
devices on TWC in Dayton, OH.

Using host star.c10r.facebook.com [173.252.120.6].  Gives me the same error
on the web page.

I'm currently seeing this intermittently from Facebook in Southeast Asia (it doesn't appear to be MITMed, the cert checks out):

-----

Sorry, something went wrong.

We're working on getting this fixed as soon as we can.

-----

Is anyone else seeing similar issues with Facebook in Southeast Asia, or in any other region?

Then, it is not a real outage: the point of having several DNS servers
per zone is to allow one server to go down, without service
interruption.

Which domain, by the way (most messages on this mailing list are very
poor on details)?

I know this isn?t much help, but there are major problems with multiple ISPs since around 4-5 AM EST.  I really don?t have much detail, but I have sites that are unreachable from some providers.  Looks like Comcast, level3, ATT, cogent, etc.

So, it?s probably not just you, but I?m afraid I don?t know who it is.  I heard one report of a datacenter outage.

Hi,

Some routing tables hit 512K routes today. Some old hardware and
software can't handle that and either crash or ignore newly learned
routes. So this may cause some disturbances in the force.

HTH,

I guess it's nothing, I don't even remember, something about the network 
having major congestion or some sort of attack.

"Update: One of our data centers went down, we have the service fully running on another data center & are working to minimize impact."

I'm getting "An error occurred while attempting to contact the server. Please check your Internet connection." In my LastPass bar on Firefox.

So, if you're getting errors with LastPass, this is why.

I know this isn?t much help, but there are major problems with multiple ISPs since around 4-5 AM EST.  I really don?t have much detail, but I have sites that are unreachable from some providers.  Looks like Comcast, level3, ATT, cogent, etc.

So, it?s probably not just you, but I?m afraid I don?t know who it is.  I heard one report of a datacenter outage.

Hi,

Some routing tables hit 512K routes today. Some old hardware and software can't handle that and either crash or ignore newly learned routes. So this may cause some disturbances in the force.

I think it is related to this.

http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/117712-problemsolution-cat6500-00.html



But it is probably several things including 512k route limit on cisco cats.

I would imagine it's related to the global routing table hitting 512k 
routes.

I'm not so sure. None of my four upstreams is showing that many. Level3 (as an example) is 497,389 right now.

This might be an issue for some places but probably isn't the full "this is why everyone is down today" explanation.

This might be an issue for some places but probably isn't the full "this is why everyone is down today" explanation.

Cisco gear can't support more than 512K routes... We hit that or close to that at around 4am EDT today.

ISPs are scrambling to update memory in their routers.

So is this issue all related to a fiber cut or a DC/Peering point having issues?

"Update: One of our data centers went down, we have the service fully running on another data center & are working to minimize impact."

I'm getting "An error occurred while attempting to contact the server. Please check your Internet connection." In my LastPass bar on Firefox.

So, if you're getting errors with LastPass, this is why.

I know this isn?t much help, but there are major problems with multiple ISPs since around 4-5 AM EST.  I really don?t have much detail, but I have sites that are unreachable from some providers.  Looks like Comcast, level3, ATT, cogent, etc.

So, it?s probably not just you, but I?m afraid I don?t know who it is.  I heard one report of a datacenter outage.

Hi,

Some routing tables hit 512K routes today. Some old hardware and software can't handle that and either crash or ignore newly learned routes. So this may cause some disturbances in the force.

HTH,

I guess it's nothing, I don't even remember, something about the network having major congestion or some sort of attack.

That's a tcam limit on the 6500/7600 platform. It's not upgradable, but it is configurable.

The gsr platform doesn't have a hard limit like this, its just memory (And is upgradeable), but most with that gear will have already had to upgrade well before now.

So is this issue all related to a fiber cut or a DC/Peering point having issues?

"Update: One of our data centers went down, we have the service fully running on another data center & are working to minimize impact."

I'm getting "An error occurred while attempting to contact the server. Please check your Internet connection." In my LastPass bar on Firefox.

So, if you're getting errors with LastPass, this is why.

I know this isn?t much help, but there are major problems with multiple ISPs since around 4-5 AM EST.  I really don?t have much detail, but I have sites that are unreachable from some providers.  Looks like Comcast, level3, ATT, cogent, etc.

So, it?s probably not just you, but I?m afraid I don?t know who it is.  I heard one report of a datacenter outage.

Hi,

Some routing tables hit 512K routes today. Some old hardware and software can't handle that and either crash or ignore newly learned routes. So this may cause some disturbances in the force.

Looks like the internet route table got over 512k routes. Guessing some
7600's did not like that.

So is this issue all related to a fiber cut or a DC/Peering point having issues?

I'm getting "An error occurred while attempting to contact the server. Please check your Internet connection." In my LastPass bar on Firefox.

So, if you're getting errors with LastPass, this is why.

I know this isn?t much help, but there are major problems with multiple ISPs since around 4-5 AM EST.  I really don?t have much detail, but I have sites that are unreachable from some providers.  Looks like Comcast, level3, ATT, cogent, etc.

So, it?s probably not just you, but I?m afraid I don?t know who it is.  I heard one report of a datacenter outage.

Hi,

Some routing tables hit 512K routes today. Some old hardware and software can't handle that and either crash or ignore newly learned routes. So this may cause some disturbances in the force.

We were told by Quality Technology Services in Atlanta that they were "installing additional memory" to correct the issue.  Perhaps they meant they were actually reconfiguring/bouncing the routers.... I know they had Cisco engineers on site in GA, CA, and NJ today.

Either way, after our network link went totally down and came back up, the issue was resolved.

That's a tcam limit on the 6500/7600 platform. It's not upgradable, but it is configurable.

The gsr platform doesn't have a hard limit like this, its just memory (And is upgradeable), but most with that gear will have already had to upgrade well before now.

Probably they were recarving the TCAM allocation.
Quick summary document for those having the issue:
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/117712-problemsolution-cat6500-00.html

This increases the size of the TCAM allocated for v4 routes, at the
cost of v6 space. This doesn't actually *solve* the issue, but does at
least kick the can down the road a bit longer...
TCAM based solutions for FIB, while cheap to implement, leads to pain...

Previous $ employers crossed the 500k fib route point around 2007 I'm

Caron,  this might have been because you are still connected to one of the older GC 7609 aggregation switches and it couldn't handle the full RIB table for the Internet routes.  Most of those 7609's should have been replaced, you should contact Level 3 and ask when you are getting moved to the new Aggregation switches? 

Regards,
Joe Sanchez

The sup2t-xl for the 6500 series should not affected by this. The 1M TCAM space is shared and not default configured for 512k.

The gsr platform doesn't have a hard limit like this, its just memory (And is upgradeable), but most with that gear will have already had to upgrade well before now.?

So is this issue all related to a fiber cut or a DC/Peering point having issues?

I'm getting "An error occurred while attempting to contact the server. Please check your Internet connection." In my LastPass bar on Firefox.

So, if you're getting errors with LastPass, this is why.

Hi,

Some routing tables hit 512K routes today. Some old hardware and software can't handle that and either crash or ignore newly learned routes. So this may cause some disturbances in the force.

I don't see anything at the moment. I see reports of a phone issue in one
area and a problem with a couple of video channels elsewhere, but I have
not heard of anything widespread. Do you have any more details?

Thanks,

Scratch that. I did find an ongoing issue with some optical transport
affecting WI. I'm sure that's it. Possible flaky card. Sounds like they
reseated it and these issues resolved.

Negative, limited information was passed to our Helpdesk and NOC and it was
reported on a local news station.

Anyone else in the Seattle area seeing problems?

Multiple Dice Holdings sites (Slashdot/etc.) have been down for hours/a good 
part of the day depending on where you were in the country. Same symptom, DNS 
resolving but no responsse or traceroute past savvis.net. Just came back up 
here in the last 20min or so, after being down 4+ hours.

Anyone else seeing intermittent issues with GoDaddy's Nameservers? We 
have monitors for customer's sites that appear to have been flapping for 
most of the day. However the hosts are up and healthy.

Check out this thread over on the Google Public DNS list, it suggests there
is a GoDaddy problem.

There are a few other related threads  there too.

Check out this thread over on the Google Public DNS list, it suggests there is a GoDaddy problem.

https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/public-dns-discuss/TYVuxAp6LF8

There are a few other related threads  there too.

Anyone else seeing intermittent issues with GoDaddy's Nameservers? We 
have monitors for customer's sites that appear to have been flapping for 
most of the day. However the hosts are up and healthy.

We have a 10GB Lightower circuit in Mahwah, NJ going to NY down. Anyone heard of any cuts in the area? Lightower isn't saying much, currently "investigating". Anyone seen anything else?

We saw multiple service outages from Verizon local in NYC, specifically our
offices served out of Broad Street (NYCMNYBS). Lost multiple OC as well as
local voice PRI.

I haven't dug exact times out of the logs yet, but was around noon EDT.

Anyone else see similar or know what went on?

Well, I need to wind my watch... we saw path AIS on our OCs out of that CO
at 12:23:39 EDT. Cleared ten seconds later. Voice PRIs took a bit longer to
recover.

My understanding is that power in select portions of 55 Marietta has been
severed by automated fire-protection equipment and the fire-department as
of roughly 4PM eastern.

All of our primary and secondary services are currently out on the 5th, 6th
and 18th floor.

Anyone else have any additional information they may be able to provide by
chance? We have staff on-site and have been told by the fire-department
that we cannot enter the building itself until the site has been cleared.

My BGP session to HE for IPv6 has bounced twice in the last few minutes. It's been stable for years, so something is going on.

Traceroutes to the IPv4 tunnel destination get from lightpath to HE, but appear to get lost in HE.

Anyone know what's going on?

Exactly one endpoint (tserv7.ash1 at Ashburn, VA, US) is shown as "down"
on https://www.tunnelbroker.net/status.php now.

How do your traces over the tunnel compare to similar traces via

Haven't seen my message echo back to list yet, so bcc'ing OP.

Should clarify, here this is just a tunnel, no BGP.

Also the Ashburn node previously shown as 'down' is now shown as 'up' as
the entire tunnelbroker universe.

Guess we were one of the "lucky" ones that got hit by that server outage. We are back up and stable
now. Has been so stable that my first thought was that it was a bigger
problem

More info, such as the IPv4 and IPv6 traceroutes you 
speak of, would be helpful.

Subject: [outages] Microsoft/XBoxlive issue
Message-ID: <532EC7AB-72FA-4FCA-B97E-36E3E6F2B9D4@inoc.net>

We are seeing a return routing issue from Microsoft sites (all of them; xboxlive, microsoft.com, etc)

These are the only sites we're currently having reachability issues with.  We're uplinked to Level3, Centurylink, NTT and Cogent out of NYC, Boston, etc. 

If I traceroute to 134.170.188.221, I die 1-2 hops in each carrier.  I'm assuming this is a return path traffic issue as I have good BGP routes to Microsoft sites.  So far, we're only seeing this to Microsoft and no others.  It's confirmed that we can access these sites from off of our network.

If anyone from MS/Xboxlive monitors this list, can you contact me off-list please?

For everyone else, if you could copy/paste me a traceroute to 64.246.132.194 (offlist) that would be great.

TIA

-Robert

I'm not seeing any problems with connecting to outlook.com/lync, and no 
noticeable issues with using O365. Seems that Microsoft and the Xbox 
Live website are fine on my end as well.
I'm in Richardson, TX, using TWCable.

anyone else experiencing DID issues with pac-west? calls either are

they're having media issues and there is no ETA.

the last pacwest outage was just a few months ago when one wilshire did 
a power test and their router didn't return.. for 15 or so hours.

Internap just informed us that their is a fiber cut in the SFO002 area affecting XO (one of their peering partners).

We're not seeing any issues from it other than a brief route flap when it happened.

I've been dealing with this all day as well. PW reports the issue as starting at about 8a PDT, which lines up with what I've been seeing.?


It's a switch issue and their working with the vendor to correct it with no ETR.
