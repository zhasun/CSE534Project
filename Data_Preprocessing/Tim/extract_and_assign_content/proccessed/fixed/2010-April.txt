Windstream is currently experiencing significant landline outages across Lancaster, Butler, Cass, Saunders and other counties in the southeastern Nebraska area, as reported by KLIN, a local news radio station.

Anyone on this list know more?

Amateur radio operators are spreading throughout the city for communication assistance.

Andy,

Nothing more than what you have stated.

Apparently both redundant links to the switch facility failed w/ no
estimated time for resolution.

911 service for landlines has been restored but not to cell phones.

Hey all -

Just passing along and I have no technical specifics, but one of our remote
network enginneers is reporting WAN issues that seem isolated to TWTelecom
Orlando, per their TWTC network reps: "2 DS3's down in the Orlando area."

We we've been experiencing increasing packet loss from/to WAN and company's
Florida office here over the last hour.

No ETR as of yet.

acting wonky today, and I'm not sure if it's the provider or

We did finally get confirmation last night that this is internal to our

Does anyone across the pond have any further insight into this cut?

Although SEA-ME-WE 3 and 4 are suppose to provide redundancy for
eachother, not sure what impact has SMW4 segment caused, maybe latency?


Any feedback will be appreciated.

There's a cut in SWM4

*SMW4 Segment 4.1 cable fault*

Cable shunt fault developed on SMW4 segment 4.1 (Egypt / Alexandria ?
Branching Unit #4A onward France / Marseilles) at 07:15GMT on 14-Apr. 2010.
However the shunt fault has further deteriorated and the cable segment was
down at 10:03GMT.  Only four unprotected Singapore ? London / Frankfurt
STM-4c IP trunks were being affected.

SMW4 NOC updated that there is a shunt fault in segment 4.1 between  Egypt /
Alexandria and France / Marseilles with cable fault on Fiber Pair #2 at
1886.152 km from Alexandria towards Palermo.  The traffic landed at Palermo
onwards to Europe was being affected, while the traffic running between
Alexandria and Marseilles via Fiber Pair #1 is still maintained.

i'm not sure one necessarily fails to the other... if people don't subscribe
to the other for restoral or if they're supersmart--  to one of the
transrussia overland routes, they're out of luck.

i frankly don't believe enough capacity exists on the transrussia cables to
backup swm3 and swm4.

i work for a network based across the pond

Maybe outages as such may spark some interest in routing more capacity
from europe and asia over the transrussia networks.

We've had a London - Kolkata MPLS link go down and come back with twice it's
normal latency. Am still awaiting more explanation from the provider but
certainly looks like no capacity on similar paths leading to routing "the
other way" round the world.

Word on the street is that AT&T is currently experiencing an OC12 outage

as Davenport, IA.

We're still trying to get an exact description of what happened as well

I heard there is a fiber outage in Sunnyvale that has taken out most of
the city. Can someone from AT&T Provide any kind of clue on what's going
on? I'm being told by one of our partners that their entire building is
without service in Sunnyvale and apparently they've talked to other
businesses in the area that have fiber-based services who are also down.

Would it be possible for them to contact ATT or you on their behalf
rather then the list?

Apparently Etisalat (UAE's) the local submarine cable?s local operator
is reporting the problem occurred when seawater penetrated the
insulation and caused a short-circuit. Not sure the extent of this
disruption.

In the meanwhile traffic is being rerouted to accommodate country's demand.

The operator did not say when normal internet service might resume.

AT&T is reporting some major service problems with their optiman fiber

master ticket or global status. The last I heard was there was no ETA
for resolution.

It appears that SourceForge is down. I have tried from 3 different
locations and it is completely unresponsive. It gets as far as
das3-v3037.ch3.savvis.net (64.37.207.178), then drops off the face of
the Earth.

Any idea what is up?

We are *well* past the point where we need to go back to making Internet
backbone architecture design decisions on an engineering, rather than a
financial basis.

Public corporations clearly can be trusted only to do that which the 
business environment and laws demand: Maximize Shareholder Value.

That is almost *never* the same as Maximizing the Public Good.

Unless we fix the first, we must regulate to achieve the second.

This is a recording<tm>.

Just FYI we were having problems with receiving local calls from ATT into ATT numbers that were ported into our network. The callers are hearing a disco message and in the message ATT is offering up other numbers for similar companies.  ATT has come back with saying they have dumped 35K+ old dico'd numbers back into their network. No ETR from them.

Correct me if I'm wrong but aren't RST's sent by the TCP stack in the 
webserver?  If you are recieving them it would imply that the network 
connection is fine, but you were sent to a server that is having issues. 
WIth the amount of traffic they recieve I would assume they use some sort 
of load balancing method.  Try clearing your DNS cache and closing your 
browser and trying again.

RSTs are sent by the OS (not the "webserver"; there is no TCP stack
inside a webserver) when the underlying userland application calls
close(2) on the descriptor (socket), the process exits, or otherwise
aborts/crashes in some way thus freeing the descriptor that handles the
network I/O.  Facebook's predominantly using Linux[1] which is why I
describe the above model.

Given Facebook's complexity, who knows what the problem was.  Load
balancer or layer 7 filter/re-writer (think F5) issues?  Back-end server
problems?  Software misconfiguration?  Doing burn-outs in an AMC Pacer
by sticking with PHP[2]?  Some developer deciding to just roll something
out in the middle of the day (as is quite common with social networking
sites these days)?  We'll probably never know.

If I had a nickel for every time I've seen FB's environment behave
erratically (easy to confirm with curl), close sockets abruptly, time
out during HTTP transactions, I'd own a series of small islands by now.

By webserver I meant the box not the daemon running on it.  I wasn't 
trying to give everyone a lesson on TCP, I was just implying that the 
original post about the problem being based on a location were probably 
false.  I'm still curious if it was the entire site or just a few of the 
servers in a load-balanced pool

<hat type="assistant moderator">

Exactly, and we've discussed this in the past.  Web service providers of
A Certain Size become valid fodder for this list, as many of our members
do eyeball-network support, and will get calls when their end user customers
can't access these service.

We realize that for some of you, that's not as important as INOC-DBA failures,
but that hasn't been the entirety of the Internet for some decades now.

Mail filters are pretty common these days, guys.

And everyone please remember to move discussions to outages-discuss; that's 
what's it's for.

I received a call from Verizon about "your Verizon phone service" with
no CID. On my Sprint cell phone. Something is confused.

The calls are from the Verizon SIP network in the NorthEast.  CID information is being passed into our network as "OUT OF SERVICE + Phone Number".  Very strange to be honest.  Called Verizon VoIP and they are baffled..

Switched calls, dedicated calls, LD/Local only, etc... any other details?

Anybody with Sprint know why *3 and online billing are down? I don't feel like being late paying today when I can't even get anything to respond.

Does anyone else use SNPP for paging? I'm having trouble with Sprint's
SNPP server lately, i.e. it's not responding or takes way too long and
times out.

snpp.messaging.sprint.com port 444
Resolves to 64.41.153.7

Im wondering if there was some kind of widespread phone issue.  Don't know if it's related, but I had trouble dialing 908 numbers and a 603 number.  Kept getting a fast busy.  Whole thing lasted about 30 min, ended about 10-15 min ago.
