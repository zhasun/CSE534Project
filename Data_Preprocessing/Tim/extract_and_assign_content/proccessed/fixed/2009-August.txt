We're seeing many sites down that are on TimeWarner Cable internet in  
the Austin TX Metro area.  Anyone know what happened?

I'm working from home today and I'm seeing some very weird issues that appear to be routing related. I'm in Westchester NY on Verizon Fios. I have reachability to some sights, but even those seem to be slowly disappearing. Global routing issues?

Looks like it is back up, somewhat.  I was unable to trace from Time
warner telecom Austin to time warner road runner. now I am tracing
through Dallas but it used to trace through an Austin cross
connect(Duval or Downtown) between twtelecom.net and res.austin.rr.com

I saw it about 2 hours ago.  I am able to ftp to ftp.cisco.com, but
unable to reach www.cisco.com; saw it down in
http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.cisco.com as well.  Figured it
was temporary, but hadn't tried again.

The prefix 198.133.219.0/24 does not appear in either of our bgp tables.

Both ftp.cisco.com and www.cisco.com resolve in that subnet.

Someone is having a bad morning.

Yes, I'm seeing it here - we're connected via Level3 in Southfield 
MI, and Bell Canada in Windsor, Ontario.

http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.cisco.com

Reports it as down as well.

Update off cisco blog:

http://blogs.cisco.com/news/comments/final_update_ciscocom_outage/

cut and paste for those who like to see text version:

FINAL UPDATE:  Cisco.com Outage

Service to Cisco.com <http://www.cisco.com/> has been restored and all
applications are now fully operational.  The issue occurred during
preventative maintenance of one of our data centers when a human error
caused an electrical overload on the systems.  This caused
Cisco.com<http://www.cisco.com/>and other applications to go down.
Because of the severity of the overload,
the redundancy measures in some of the applications and power systems were
impacted as well, though the system did shut down as designed to protect the
people and the equipment. As a result, no data were lost and no one was
injured. Cisco has plans already in process to add additional redundancies
to increase the resilience of these systems.
Again, we thank our customers and our partners for their patience during the
resolution of this issue.




regards,
/virendra

FINAL UPDATE:  Cisco.com Outage


Service to Cisco.com <http://www.cisco.com/>  has been restored and all
applications are now fully operational.  The issue occurred during
preventative maintenance of one of our data centers when a human error
caused an electrical overload on the systems.  This caused Cisco.com
<http://www.cisco.com/>  and other applications to go down.  Because of the
severity of the overload, the redundancy measures in some of the
applications and power systems were impacted as well, though the system did
shut down as designed to protect the people and the equipment. As a result,
no data were lost and no one was injured. Cisco has plans already in process
to add additional redundancies to increase the resilience of these systems. 
Again, we thank our customers and our partners for their patience during the
resolution of this issue.

You forgot the first line on the web page:

    August 09, 2007

I'm guessing it is not related.

Subject: [outages] AT&T -> T-Mobile SMS?
Message-ID: <20090804202617.GD1141129@hiwaay.net>

Is anyone else seeing problems sending SMS from AT&T to T-Mobile (or
other providers)?  When my monitoring system sends a message (via a GSM
modem with an AT&T SIM card) "Test page 3", AT&T accepts the message,
but I get an SMS back in just a few seconds from 1121611611 that says:

1xxxxxxxxxx Error Invalid Number. Please re-send using a valid 10 digit mobile number or valid short code. Test page 3

where xxxxxxxxxx is the 10 digit T-Mobile number I sent a message to.
It looks like something on the network is prepending a "1" and then
rejecting the message because of the "1".

This has been working fine for a while and just quit working today
sometime.

I just sent an SMS to a T-Mobile phone from my ATT iPhone and had no issues.

We are receiving all trunks busy on Telepacific PRI in Los Angeles.  Their
NOC (877-487-8349 or 213-213-3899) are also failing to recording.

We have heard that there is a power outage somewhere in the area South Bay
(near LAX).

Not sure if it's related but, I used e-mail -> ATT SMS and my girlfriend 
got some of them immediatley while most of them were delayed for a few 
hours.  This went on around 11am PDT.

Typically, it's instantaneous.  Not sure if the delay was on Google's 
SMTP end, ATT's end, or both.

Maybe that's due to 40-acre fire burning around suburban Glendale.

Message-ID: <29208970.524321249571733704.JavaMail.root@benjamin>

Additionally, I was told last night by a Nextel International rep that the
reason my Nextel phone could get SMS (well, ok, MMS) and TCP but not *voice*
(DC is unknown; my partner has a crossover phone, and Qchat will not roam to
Canada at *all*) is that there's some centralized outage between the two 
networks.  My phone says the quite unusual 'nXTL'.

I gathered an impression that the problem was something like a breakage
between the master Canadian VLR and the HLR at Sprint/Nextel, but the rep 
wasn't technical to actually be able to tell me details (I'd be glad to hear
some details, if anyone on the list has them).

Cheers,

They're being targeted by a DDoS.: http://status.twitter.com/

Facebook is likely being hit, too; there are reports that it's been up

Actually, I'm seeing the same thing. What's strange, is I'm not even
hitting google-related sites (as far as I can tell, perhaps they have
some API on their backend).

http://pacscilife.blogspot.com/

>From one AS i get the sorry page, from another I'm able to surf fine.
Doesn't seem to be impacting direct connections to google.com, just
clicking out of Gmail, for example.

Anyone else seeing this, and what symptoms?

Actually, I'm seeing the same thing. What's strange, is I'm not even hitting google-related sites (as far as I can tell, perhaps they have some API on their backend).

Doesn't seem to be impacting direct connections to google.com, just clicking out of Gmail, for example.

Anyone else seeing this, and what symptoms?

That blog displays fine here (AS 7024)

They may be blocking depending upon where they are getting attacked from.
Since we aren't a huge consumer network we may not have any bots hitting

We have received that message when performing Google searches before. A quick way to make it go away is to change the NAT/PAT address you use for your workstations.

I would be interested in seeing what others find has caused this. The few time it happened at work, I could not find any root cause.

If you ask Google (via the URL provided) they will eventually get back to
you with a time range when they saw the traffic that they detected as
"unusual"/automated.

Getting back on topic a little, the below blog URL was returning the error
here but is now working fine so I suspect they have fixed the problem for
some users at least.

Embarq customers in minnesota have now been without internet access for
almost 24 hours. confirmed this evening with embarq support that they
are "waiting for parts" and repair will most likely not be until sunday.
Parts? Really Embarq? You need to wait for parts? Are you not a regional
ISP that serves at least 250000 people? And isn't the Qwest/Cisco parts
depot something like 30 miles away?
 
What I want to know is who at embarq is going to get canned for letting
a service contract expire or not having the appropriate spare hardware?
 
 
P.S. Hey Embarq engineers, BGP was designed so you could have more than
one upstream provider.

A tip to all outages.org members. Do you want your connections to come
back up immediatly? Send a sarcastic outage report to outages.org
chastising your provider and like magic, your connection will come back
up.
 
Embarq customers in minnesota now have internet access again.

well, I dunno; that's what I was trying to do with my Nextel posting the
other day, and it's *STILL* down up here; on top of which my partner has a
CDMA QChat nextel phone and DC doesn't roam for him... *and* while my SMS
to the states works fine, all of *his* SMSs in both directions are delayed
over half an hour; I've already missed at least one good Worldcon event
because for all we pay them every month, they've left us *no* working way
to communicate with one another in real time.

I'm probably flying home via Lenexa; I really feel the need to get in a suit's
face about this; we are *not* paying for this month.

Cheers,

Have a look at http://internetpulse.com/ im in denver area, and our routing to some of our local Comcast customers is HORRID.  Timing out like mad, 150-200ms latency where it should be 30-40ms.

Can you be more specific?  I'm not seeing any problems getting to Savvis

Did anyone experience issues with ATT and Comcast between 8-9:00 PM on 8/10 ? 
There was also some talk about a fiber cut in bay area, but I could not find anything on

I'm a Comcast subscriber in the bay, and I do pretty extensive
monitoring of Comcast IP connectivity/reliability (both incoming and
outgoing).

I witnessed no service interruptions on 2009/08/10 between 2000-2100
PDT, and my periodic traceroutes/mtrs show no indication of IP network
reconvergence that took place during that time frame.  My IP tests do
not utilise Comcast<-->AT&T paths though, only Comcast<-->Level3 or
Comcast<-->Abovenet.

Packets from my Comcast connection to a destination in Santa Clara
normally go from Mountain View -> Oakland -> Sacramento -> San Jose ->
Santa Clara.  This is visible in traceroute/mtr.

The best place to look for outage reports of this sort is on
BroadbandReports/DSLreports.  The below lists are for general forum
discussion and direct Comcast-employee-to-customer support, respectively
(you won't be able to read the latter posts, but you can see the
Topics).

http://www.dslreports.com/forum/comcast
http://www.dslreports.com/forum/comcastdirect

Additionally, my night job involves monitoring quite a few links in and
out of the Bay via different transport providers, and nothing was
witnessed with AT&T on the night of 2009/08/10.

Hope this helps.

I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, but, this is the first  
Month that Comcast has
been able to achieve one 9 of reliability since my service was  
installed in January.

No, I'm not exaggerating, they literally are down ~3-4 days each month  
until now.
Before you get too impressed, they have yet to achieve a second 9 of  
reliability,
even this month.

Appears to be sporadic (again); Blogspot URLs are loading OK from here
via AS4323. Was last week's outage a DDoS, or just server goofiness at

Our texas NMS picked up ingress routing trouble to Level(3) prefixes around
3:00AM PST. Traffic to SFO and SJC from Dallas was headed through London.
Level(3) seemed to correct this after about 45 minutes.

Yes.  Started at 3:36am Pacific, and ended at 4:12am.

Looks like level 3 were advertising their US routes out of London, with
latency from non-L3 in San Francisco to multiple Level 3 around 200ms and
near 100% packet loss.

I saw up to 40% packet-loss on the Comcast network between
Sacramento/Portland, for intermittent periods of time between 9AM-3PM
PST. It's been stable the past few hours.

 

This was seen both via Level3 and Sprint from my perspective.

Level 3 had a routing loop problem in San francisco on 8/8-8/9. We had
issues with 

Comcast customers being able to access some websites. Did anyone see
anything similar ?

I'm seeing some minor packet loss traversing Level3 in Chicago.

We connect to their network in Detroit, and we're clean until the 
first hop into Chicago.

Anyone else seeing anything like that?

Further to the issue below - I'm typically seeing packet loss at hop 
5.  This particular trace doesn't show it though, although there are 
timeouts on hop 6.

It would be helpful if you could use something like mtr instead of
traceroute in this case.  The below trace could be indicating ICMP
de-prioritisation on L3 routers, which is known to be enabled, but could
also be an indicator of packet loss starting at hop #5 and "trickling
down" through succeeding hops (possibly #10 or #11).

mtr --order=LSRNABW can help in diagnosing this.

I'm here in Kansas City, KS region and a trace to that IP in Detroit for 
Level3 shows this with the flags you have added for mtr. Level3 is just 
having a bad week me thinks.

I know Nlayer has multiple cities with Level3, try doing ping/ 
traceroutes using their Looking Glass. I also provided  l3 LG too.

The packet loss shown at hops #4, #5, and possibly #6 is either ICMP
deprioritisation or high CPU utilisation on said routers.  My vote is
the lesser, given that it's common these days, and most backbone
providers are known to use it (L3, Abovenet, Sprint, Verizon/MCI, and
AT&T just to name a few).

The 18ms jump between hop #3 and #4 is likely normal due to geographic
distance, though I don't know where hop #3 is located; #4 is obviously
Missouri.  The same goes for the 12ms increase between #6 and #7

If this evidence was presented to Level 3, I can assure you they'd tell
you the same thing.  Here's a similar example showing the exact
behaviour I describe but within the Comcast network.  Note hop #6:

Here's another.  Note hops #7, #8, and #9 (all Cogent), and also note in
this example the increased latency at hop #7 and #8 which doesn't
continue downwards through later hops:

The easiest way to determine if there's a problem is whether or not the
loss witnessed at a hop continues down through succeeding hops.  Here's
a real life example (IPs removed for security reasons):

HOST: ----------------------      Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
  1. ---------------               0.0%    60    6.8   6.0   0.4  85.9  16.1

  8. 204.70.194.18                88.3%    60   35.0  34.9  34.7  35.1   0.1
  9. 204.70.194.10                88.3%    60   34.9  35.0  34.7  35.6   0.3

 12. ---------------              100.0    60    0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0

What you see here was an issue with SAVVIS.  The root cause was a router
of theirs which rebooted unexpectedly.

The destination (hop #12) drops ICMP, so 100% loss there was completely
normal -- the rest wasn't.  This was determined by comparing the loss to
historic data when the issue with SAVVIS wasn't occurring.

And one more example -- which just occurred about 10 minutes ago on my
home Comcast connection:

What happened here?  Based on my router logs, it appears DHCP expired
and numerous daemons on the router were automatically restarted (this is
normal in such a circumstance).  It's possible that Comcast's DHCP
servers took too long to respond to a renewal and the router chose to
down/up the WAN interface, or possibly restart relevant daemons.  Hard
to say -- the logging isn't as verbose as I'd like.

My cable modem log doesn't indicate LOS nor being rebooted, so this was
purely an IP-related issue, or issue with my own equipment.

The packet loss shown at hops #4, #5, and possibly #6 is either ICMP

You could know this if you used tcptraceroute instead: michael.toren.net/code/tcptraceroute

There is something similar (but I can't remember the tool name) for micro$loth.

Is there version of mtr that include support for TCP or UDP types?  A google
search didn't reveal anything to me, but would be the best of mtr with the
benefits of tcptraceroute.

It would be helpful if you could use something like mtr instead of
traceroute in this case.  The below trace could be indicating ICMP
de-prioritisation on L3 routers, which is known to be enabled, but could
also be an indicator of packet loss starting at hop #5 and "trickling
down" through succeeding hops (possibly #10 or #11).

mtr --order=LSRNABW can help in diagnosing this.

The closest thing I know of is PingPlotter for Windows.

I'll remind folks that TCP and UDP-based traceroute/mtr-like utilities
still rely on ICMP time exceeded (type 11) being sent out to obtain the
present path, so if folks are looking for a pure TCP or UDP-based
traceroute or equivalent, to avoid dropping of ICMP, they're barking up
the wrong tree.  :-)

Good point.  Is the ICMP rate-limiting of these largish routers ingress and
egress, or only ingress-only?

That's an excellent question -- and one I've always wondered myself.

This is purely speculative, but I believe outbound ICMP (e.g. sent from
the router to whatever src solicited it) is what's de-prioritised.

Someone more familiar with Cisco and Juniper equipment might know for
certain.

Usually packets destined to the control-plane of the system are
prioritized based on criteria. It is better to let routing control
protocols (e.g. ospf, bgp, isis) through first than someone pinging or
running a traceroute. Packets *through* the router take the normal
forwarding path and are not affected by this system.

There may be system defaults based on hardware/software, but Cisco has
CoPP and I believe Juniper uses a firewall on the lo0 interface (been a
while since I touched one) for user-defined rules.

Yes, and when pure prioritization is not available, ISPs
will use rate limiting too which is one of the ways
Level 3 restricts ICMP to the cpu on the core devices.

Also, the car device is an edge router so there could be
congestion on a customer port too when higher response times
are seen on the other side of a hop. Response times that settle
could be the control plane/data plane issue or could be once 
traffic gets to a far end there's an asymetric path that goes
a different return path rather than back across the link seen on 
the forward traceroute. All these are why simple pings and 
traceroutes don't always tell the story.

Don't forget that it is behind a 'tier one' network.  SIngle homed  
behind that network, but tier ones are physically incapable of going

We have 2 Level3 DS-3 circuits down here in Denver. Anyone else experiencing 
Level3 problems in the Denver area?

I'm not in Denver but in Fresno, CA and use Unwired Broadband.

I did notice around 11:30am PST I had some horrible congestion.  It 
appeared to me at the time it was within the Level 3 network.

I don't have any other details at the moment.  It seemed to last from 
around 10:45am to around 11:45am, so around an hour.

Situation is fine now.

May be a local loop problem.

Subject: [outages] for those not in LA:  fire vs. power lines
Message-ID: <1251760140.5879.7.camel@localhost>

Hello...

FYI for those not seeing the Los Angeles fires on the news constantly.

http://www.ladwpnews.com/go/doc/1475/318099/

The Station Fire has the potential to cross and affect the Department's
500 KV transmission lines northeast of the Acton area today. These
high-voltage power lines are critical to maintaining a steady supply of
power to the city, especially as demand for energy rises throughout the
day.

To make up for the potential loss of power transmission, the LADWP has
activated all in-basin power plants in order to generate energy.
