=============================================================

I note that Google's DNS servers, which my router seems to be pointed at,
seem to be authoritative for *everything*; I'm not sure what I think about
that.  Forcing a.root did show the results I expected, though.

Cheers,

SOA for ebay.com does indicate, assuming serial is to be interpreted in
the usual YYYYMMDDnn format, that they haven't changed anything in ~2
days.

Traceroute to any of the above DNS servers is worthless, as they appear
to drop ICMP at the immediate borders of their networks.

For the time being we are using  google and OpenDNS as DNS forwarders. 
I am opening a ticket with Cogent now.

Thank you everyone,

eBay drops ICMP at their network borders.

Furthermore, ping != DNS.

Hmmm.  Let me phrase it differently: 

When I dig +trace, I do not expect GDNS to be the first hop, and the end 
records to be the second.  I'm not sure what is causing that, but I'm 
relatively sure it's something doubleplus ungood.  See the two traces in
my original posting, if it's not clear what I'm complaining about.

Cheers,

Subject: [outages] Level3 taking the Southern Route from Boston to Poughkeepsie
Message-ID: <3BC1A15C-5BFE-48AF-BA3A-B9599F95883C@simons-rock.edu>

Hi,

Bard College at Simon's Rock (simons-rock.edu) is a small college in  
Southwestern Mass, with our parent campus, Bard (bard.edu), in the  
Hudson Valley near Rhinebeck, NY.

We use a database hosted on the main campus, and poor database  
performance here is often correlated with Level3 / Global Crossing  
issues in New York city. Today my users are complaining about slow  
database response, and I find that traceroutes from here, and from  
Level3's Looking Glass Boston page now go from NYC to Poughkeepsie via  
Washington, Atlanta, and Miami. This is a new routing; traces from  
past months went directly from NYC to Poughkeepsie.

I've reported this to our provider, who has presumably passed it along  
to Level3, but I'm wondering if these goofy routes are part of a work- 
around of some bigger issue in NYC, or just a screw up, or perhaps  
there is some valid business reason for this routing change?

Anyone else seeing strangeness via Level3 from NYC to the Hudson?


Here's Level3's traceroute, from http://lg.level3.net/traceroute/traceroute.cgi?site=bos1&target=hyphen.bard.edu

(In the past, we sometimes got a nice short route directly from Level3  
in Boston to Lightower.net in Boston, as Lightower seems to have a  
direct link Poughkeepsie to Boston. However, when Level3 merged with  
Global Crossing, our route to Bard started going through NYC to reach  
Lightower, which has been more troublesome.)

Thanks for any hints you can offer.

This could be an NNI or peering disconnect between light tower and Level3.  Light tower has been doing maintenance on different nodes... They have been know to forget to notify their peers .

Steve,

And what about a traceroute from hyphen.bard.edu to wherever that L3
looking glass is?  Since the source (of the looking glass) doesn't
appear to be shown, I would say a traceroute from hyphen.bard.edu to
4.69.132.242 would be the 2nd best thing to have (and ignore any packet
loss you see at that destination; it's a router not a machine).

Just last week on the mailing list I covered the importance of having
traceroutes from both directions, re: asymmetrical routing.  The PDF
I've linked should be read in full:

Thanks Jeremy,

I saw your post last week, and found it very useful. In fact the route  
is asymmetrical: traces from Bard back to us go from Lightower's  
Poughkeepsie location directly to Boston, and skip NYC altogether -- I  
wish we could get that route both directions!

My concern is that the traceroute from here to Bard was suddenly much  
longer than in past months, and I got the same results directly from  
Level3, so that made me think it wasn't something goofy with our last  
mile. But, as John noted above, now it works as expected now from  
Level3's page, and also from our site. I don't know if the timing of  
this fix shortly after my post was just coincidental, or if the ticket  
I filed with my provider at 12:30 finally trickled through the system,  
or if perhaps the act of posting to Outages got someone at Level3 to  
notice.

In any case, it works again now the way it did yesterday, so I'm all  
set.

Looks Like BT are suffering a national issue with accessing sites outside
of the UK

Affects broadband and leased line customers.

Trying to call them results in an automated message saying as such and v
long wait times (over 30mins and still no-one to talk to ..)

Broadband status page
http://btbusiness.custhelp.com/app/service_status/also shows this
issue.

We have been seeing a lot of latency and packetloss via their GBLX links 
today.

Traceroutes as of around 15 mins ago to the sites I've been testing 
to/from now traverse Level(3) instead with no loss.

I'm not surprised Go-Daddy went in the direction of "internal network events
that corrupted router data tables". It is definitely the lesser of the two
evils. To come out and admit they were hacked or experienced a DDOS would
make Customers feel their information on Go-Daddy servers was potentially
compromised. Hence the CEO's statement, " At no time was any customer data
at risk or were any of our systems compromised."

Unless there's a government investigation, which is doubtful, none of us
will really ever know what truly happened.

Frankly, "we were ddos'd" is a much better sell than "we screwed up our
internal systems horribly because we're idiots.". Surprised they went this
direction.

Subject: [outages] Call Centric Sip outage
Message-ID: <CAPC+kK6PoF1cQ3fPhhwZLrT64K83jx-V2fKg-HPkvYX6EGPo7A@mail.gmail.com>

Call centric is reporting they are experiencing a DDOS style attack using
the SIP protocol. My registrations are just timing out.

There twitter is being updated: https://twitter.com/Callcentric They are
also posting updates to customers when the log in. According to the first
post regarding this issue on their twitter this is going on hour 17 or so.
My logs for asterisk are just filling with registration time outs.

Here is the latest update when I log into my account:

*Investigation into current problems:*
For the past two days we have been experiencing a sophisticated type of
attack. As soon we noticed the first attempt we commenced an immediate
physical upgrade to all of our servers increasing capacity and CPU power by
a factor of four in addition to other precautions. Unfortunately even
though this is similar to a "typical" DDoS attack it is targeted
specifically at the SIP protocol and causes server load to increase to 100%
within 1 minute of initiation. As such, standard and extraordinary
prevention measures were unable to prevent it. We do not know the specific
methodology of the attack but are aware that it is *similar* in effect to a
DNS TRASH flood attack. We are performing forensic analysis on the data we
have and are capturing traffic to find an exact reason and solution.

We would like to clarify that there was no intrusion into our network and
all of our servers switches and internet connections have been functioning
*normally* throughout the entirety of this concern. None of our equipment
or interlinks were disconnected or went down. Additionally please note that
all of your information is encrypted, safe and secure; and that NO customer
data was stolen NOR destroyed.

We have experienced attempted *unsuccessful* attacks in the past and have
made changes in real-time to stop them as well as to prevent future similar
attacks. Many of our security documentation guidelines and features have
been geared towards these changes. Unfortunately this is an entirely new
type of attack, the mechanics of which are still coming to light.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. We are
committed to further protecting our network and for this reason we will
continue working with our engineers to implement a proper solution to
provide a comprehensive resolution.

If you have any questions/concerns regarding this message or if you need
assistance in updating your configuration our Support Staff are available
to answer your questions in as timely a manner as possible.

Upon achieving a resolution, we will be providing as detailed an
explanation as possible regarding this issue as well as the resolution.

Again, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that you have
experienced as a result of this matter and we appreciate your understanding
during this process.

Obviously the explanation of the incident had to be consumed by the general public, however we encountered an unknown bug that was found which started the domino effect. Aside from this group, that level of detail wouldn't be understood by a majority of the recipients.

With that said, please feel free to take this off list with Jason or Myself.

http://www.clear.com has been down for at least the last hour. They've also sent two emails during the last hour that my service with them has been disconnected due to a billing problem (they recently charged me, seemed to go through okay). One already connected device is still working okay, but my other device hangs trying to authenticate.

If you're using Clear for connectivity, i'd suggest not disconnecting until they get this worked out. :)

Customer service phone number is overloaded as well, and will disconnect
after several seconds of being connected.

I got one of these emails(we can't bill you and have turned off your
service), and I am an ex-customer( by over a year and half). I got through
to the customer support line, and they mention that a large number of
emails were sent out by mistake, and that there shouldn't be anything wrong
with your account.

I haven't used their service in over two years and they've been sending out
emails hourly about billing issues.  Their chat support line is currently
slammed with people that I assume are having issues.

They say in a later tweet that they posted "instructions" to customers regarding changes to make.  Have you seen anything like this on your dashboard?

And the irony continues.  I opened a Clear account back in 2010 and
closed it after one month.  Since closing it, I haven't receive any
emails at all (marketing or account related) until now - TWO YEARS
LATER, and for an account closed for that period.  Clearly a mess up
on Clear's side on multiple levels.

Ok, well new update while I was gone, not sure when they posted it:

*Investigation into current problems:*
Hello,

For the past two days we have been experiencing a sophisticated type of
attack. As soon we noticed the first attempt we commenced an immediate
physical upgrade to all of our servers increasing capacity and CPU power by
a factor of four in addition to other precautions. Unfortunately even
though this is similar to a "typical" DDoS attack it is targeted
specifically at the SIP protocol and causes server load to increase to 100%
within 1 minute of initiation. As such, standard and extraordinary
prevention measures were unable to prevent it. We do not know the specific
methodology of the attack but are aware that it is *similar* in effect to a
DNS TRASH flood attack. We are performing forensic analysis on the data we
have and are capturing traffic to find an exact reason and solution.

We would like to clarify that there was no intrusion into our network and
all of our servers switches and internet connections have been functioning
*normally* throughout the entirety of this concern. None of our equipment
or interlinks were disconnected or went down. Additionally please note that
all of your information is encrypted, safe and secure; and that NO customer
data was stolen NOR destroyed.

We have been working as aggressively as possible throughout the day/night
and we have found a short term work-around which will provide immediate
relief and allow calls to function normally. This will require updating
your configuration slightly. Please re-configure your software/hardware
with the following information:

*UPDATED*

Your registrar and Domain should remain as is:

callcentric.com

Outbound proxy:

sip.callcentric.com - For clients *ONLY* able to use A records
srv.callcentric.com - For clients able to use DNS SRV
bypass.callcentric.com - For clients able to use DNS SRV

*UPDATED*

Asterisk users need the following:

host = sip.callcentric.com OR srv.callcentric.com
outboundproxy = sip.callcentric.com OR srv.callcentric
register => 1777MYCCID:SUPERSECRET at sip.callcentric.com OR
1777MYCCID:SUPERSECRET at srv.callcentric.com

*UPDATED*

3CX users need the following:

Outbound proxy hostname or IP: sip.callcentric.com
Outbound proxy port (default is 5060): 5060

*UPDATED*

PAP2/Linksys/Cisco users should be logged into their device in
admin/advanced mode and use the following settings:

Proxy - Enter callcentric.com in this field
Outbound Proxy - Enter srv.callcentric.com in this field
Use Outbound Proxy - yes
Use DNS SRV - yes
DNS SRV Auto Prefix - yes

*UPDATED*

Obihai users please make sure the following is configured:

Service Providers > ITSP Profile > SIP

ProxyServer: callcentric.com
RegistrarServer: srv.callcentric.com
UserAgentDomain: callcentric.com
OutboundProxy: srv.callcentric.com
X_ProxyServerRedundancy: Checked

Please update this information as soon as possible to restore your calling
ability and make sure to *REBOOT* or *RESTART* your device or software.

We have experienced attempted *unsuccessful* attacks in the past and have
made changes in real-time to stop them as well as to prevent future similar
attacks. Many of our security documentation guidelines and features have
been geared towards these changes. Unfortunately this is an entirely new
type of attack, the mechanics of which are still coming to light.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. We are
committed to further protecting our network and for this reason we will
continue working with our engineers to implement a proper solution to
provide a comprehensive resolution.

If you have any questions/concerns regarding this message or if you need
assistance in updating your configuration our Support Staff are available
to answer your questions in as timely a manner as possible.

Upon achieving a resolution, we will be providing as detailed an
explanation as possible regarding this issue as well as the resolution.

Again, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that you have
experienced as a result of this matter and we appreciate your understanding
during this process.

Seeing my Level3 BGP sessions bouncing since 15:13:48 MDT and tracing in
from a CenturyLink circuit, dies with lots of packetloss on the 2nd to last
hop. Have ticket open with Level3 - waiting to hear something back.

Mike,

My two cents here, anyone in Operations who does not understand that s$%t
happens and that any company can be taken down by a set of circumstances
that they were not prepared for either does not really "work" in Operations
or is just harping on this to take a shot at GoDaddy. I have seen "perfect
storm" circumstances that set off long term outages that no one could have
predicted. I respect that fact that you spoke out on this list and
appreciate  what you could share and based on past and present experience
believe that your teams did a good the public announcement and your
comments on this list.

Thank You

Tony Pasqualini
Ops Director

Just got off the phone with our CLEC for 2 sites there with Bonded T1's and
they said the ILEC(Frontier) has a massive fiber cut in the area.

CLEC told me they are in the process of opening a Master TT with them to

Could be someone screwed up, could have been caused by a bug.

Your assumption that this was redistribution of eBGP -> IGP is not really backed up by the text. if I had to guess, I'd suppose that they have devices (like cisco 4900 series) that don't have enough memory / FIB / TCAM for full tables. Normally they only send partial routes (such as internal only / large aggregates / something) and accidentally or though a bug dropped filter and overflowed these devices?

But, whatever the case, GoDaddy has released a somewhat reasonable post-mortem, sounds like they are / have addressed the issue and os it shouldn't happen again, etc.
As many know, I'm not a real of GoDaddy, but credit where it is due?

Running a large network is non-trivial, sometimes s%#@t happens -- at least GoDaddy was willing to publish something and not just hand wave this away?

We keep kvetching that folk never publish postmortems when they have an outage -- lets not attack them when they do?

Confirmed; it's been down for a while now.

I'm sure Karl and nil will be doing something about it, if they aren't
already engaged and working the issue.  It sounds like something on the
back-end may have crashed/broke.  I'm certain Karl will disclose details
on the site once it's back up.

Well, that's just weak.  Let's publish information for some of our clients.  Yeah, the Internets will never find out...  However, they do appear to have a handle on things right now.  But the botnet is probably at reduced strength over the weekend.  They are going to have a serious case of the Mondays if they don't dial it up and get ahead of this thing.

Latest update(I didn't bother pasting the whole thing):

*Investigation into current problems:*
Hello,

*UPDATED 10/06 4:00 PM EST*

The second attack against our new servers has been suppressed.

sip.callcentric.com and srv.callcentric.com should provide better quality
and functionality and they are being continually monitored. We are still
committed to answering questions and will continue to provide as
timely/detailed support as possible.

With this in mind, we recommend subscribing/following our official Twitter
page (http://www.twitter.com/Callcentric) as we will be posting updates and
additional information as available.

The original attack is still ongoing and we are returning to this issue in
order to attempt to restore normal service across the board. This
investigation process involves deep packet inspection and analysis to
properly diagnose and prevent any other damage.

We sincerely appreciate your patience with us and again apologize for the
inconvenience.

I can 100% confirm the Alaska air delays. Here at seatac airport with current delays of 2-3 hours they say. And they might cancel flights this afternoon. Which I am currently waiting for a connecting flight that was to leave at 2:00 pm pdt to DC(REAGAN)

As I type this 3 flights to San diego and LA area were cancelled. And now they just said the system looks to be up. So there may be hope!

Alaska Air is really not multihomed?

There are Verizon outages in various Wisconsin service areas
conincidental with the timing of the Sprint DS3 outages.

Former Alltel service areas in Waupaca and New London confirmed,
possibly others.

None of the fiber or cable connections have any issues in south west Ohio.
 Assuming TWC not TWT.

One cable connection in one area having issues every night sounds like a
last mile issue, not regional at all.

Joe,

You have the wrong outage. What you are thinking about is what took place on the 8th in Oregon. What this outage was for is this

Outage occurred starting at 10amEST Oct 9th in Indy due to a fiber cut of an OC12 in AT&T territory. This was repaired at 3:30pm EST Oct 9th.

Don't know how many people are using managed dedicated servers, but:

As of about 14:40 EDT today, servers are unavailable, the website is
not functioning correctly, and nobody seems to be answering the phone.

Update:

Services seem to be restored. They responded to my tweet[0] that
service has been restored, and indeed the servers have never been
rebooted, etc.

I suspect that this has something to do with their new website launch
today[1] - further evidenced with the fact that the new site is no
longer up, the old one is there instead.

This right here is frustrating, since they are in the same city and same
network:

As you might imagine, we have a lot of complaints.

Carlos,

How about a return-path traceroute?  The ingress interface may be (and
probably is) different than the egress.

It would also help if you could provide source *and* destination IPs of
the traceroutes.

Details:

I saw packet loss on Cogent today as well.
We have a Boston and NYC site, both saw high latency and some packet
loss to almost all destination (even to other Cogent on-net POPs)

It seems to have settled down, but I have not gotten a response to
support requests.

I take it back, still seeing high latency, and very poor transfer
performance  :(

38.122.252.185 to 154.54.0.89 (BOS to PDX, Cogent on-net POPs),
spiking to 150ms latency.

The latency at hop 6 isn't necessarily related to the end-to-end problem
(as pointed out in the slides Jeremy sent)- it's not carrying through to
any later hops, so it could just be a bad asymmetric reverse path from that
particular router or that router being slow on traceroute responses. That
hop is perfectly responsive when I ping it from a variety of locations,
even if the responses are sometimes slow.

The latency to hop 10 (after Cogent) is about the same as the latency to
hop 5 (inside Cogent), and the latency doesn't really go up until the hop
in Denver (when suddenly you have a much longer path). None of my comments
say anything about the loss, however.

Just a thought have you both ruled out ICMP priortization? Cogent does
this...
Also, have you called or just submitted a ticket?

Everytime, I've opened a ticket....I've gotten a response rather quickly
and for sure when I call.

I take it back, still seeing high latency, and very poor transfer
performance  :(

38.122.252.185 to 154.54.0.89 (BOS to PDX, Cogent on-net POPs), spiking
to 150ms latency.

Sorry Otis for a double response, I hit reply to on accident (getting
tired).

I noticed a lot of latency and failure to establish connections about the
time the OP posted this message. Most of the sites in question were routing
through cogent as well. I'd bet something happened on their end, but I do
not see this happening at the moment anymore.

Otis et al,

I believe Carlos ruled out ICMP prio as a result of doing a native
server-to-server ping, from 208.86.121.129 to 66.62.162.31, as
indicated here:

> --- 66.62.162.31 ping statistics ---
> 62 packets transmitted, 40 received, 35% packet loss, time 61016ms
> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 53.803/57.115/62.127/1.730 ms

ICMP prio doesn't affect src-to-dst RTT or packet loss; it affects
src-to-administrative-router-IP situations (individual hop probes in
traceroute, sans the destination, etc.).

I think it's more likely that there is a saturated network link
somewhere, given the behaviour shown.  Seeing the return path (not for
latency or packet loss reasons, but to see the peering points) would be
useful though.

Just so nobody wastes time continuing to investigate, the outage appears to
have been from ~23:13-23:32 pacific (it's been over for 45 minutes).

Nope.

For me, this morning, www.facebook.com resolves to c10r.facebook.com, which
is 69.171.242.74, and I can't even get the first hop on a traceroute to
there; I am assuming, though my shitty FiOS Westell router doesn't bother
to say, that FiOS's core hasn't a route to that network at the moment.

I saw intermittent outages on it last night as well.  FiOS St Pete FL.

I've been seeing this since around 0930EDTish.  Saw it some yesterday
afternoon as well, intermittently.  chat.facebook.com, their Jabber server
(actually jabber-03-01-snc6.tfbnw.net (66.220.151.99)) is up fine.

Cheers,

Sorry about that - from twitter:

Looks like @Integra_Telecom DSL is down in all of 

Minnesota and North Dakota. They have identified 

the issue. 1 Hour ETA.

Hi,

I just spoke with a client's ISP, who claims that their issues with 
connectivity center around a Cogent<->Verizon peering fight.

Any word on this? Have I been asleep for a few weeks and missed something?

Could be, just did some traceroutes to Verizon and they go to Cogent 
then to L3 and finally into Verizon.  Can't say if they went directly 
into Verizon before though.

In addition to this, we saw a whole variety of "weird" problems at this time.
Internetpulse reported packet loss between multiple ISPs
(ATT/Verizon/Sprint/L3 in different directions).

We saw packet loss on Abovenet, too.

Reaching AWS was sporadic on multiple ISPs...

Anyone else see this happen too?

Looks like it was a large scale DDoS attack:

> Beginning at 00:47 GMT on 10/17/12 (please note corrected start time from original notification), customers on the Neustar UltraDNS network were subjected to a large scale DDoS attack.

Works for me here in Colorado through both CenturyLink and Cogent. Resolves 
to 208.80.48.112 for http://capitalone.com which redirects me to the same IP 
for https://www.capitalone.com.

Mark,

1. Doesn't Verizon/MCI/UUnet/Alter.net use ICMP prioritisation on their
routers?  Packet loss or latency seen at an individual router hop is
usually (not always, but usually) indicative of that.

2. You stripped hops 4 onward from your output, which doesn't help
analysis at all; if latency is truly a problem (oversaturated link,
etc.), it "trickles down" through each subsequent hop,

3. You didn't provide a return-path traceroute (e.g. dst-->src) so it's
hard to say "the problem is with Verizon" necessarily.  (I'm inclined to
believe you given their history (believe me, I'm more than familiar with
them at this point), but still...)

This may benefit you:

http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog47/presentations/Sunday/RAS_Traceroute_N47_Sun.pdf

Finally, and maybe the most important point of all:

If no loss is seen end-to-end (source-to-dest) then what's the concern?
Or are you saying there's no packet loss end-to-end but there is latency
end-to-end?  (Your Email doesn't explicitly say that, and I don't want
to make assumptions...)

Please note "FYI" at the beginning of my message.  I wasn't asking for help or analysis, I was just pointing out something that, 
based on our monitoring for the past nine months, is uncommon between the two direct-attached ports we monitor (in SJC and IAD).

Thanks,

That probably explains why I've seen access to the IPv6 version of Netflix

https://signup.netflix.com, which fails to load.

My Netflix service is working, but the menuing is "slow".

Agree. Clearly AWS issue. Emails crossed. I was investigating and composing when initial AWS post was made.

As a point of information - my consulting company has many clients,
many of whom have AWS presence in US-EAST-1, including the client I am
at right now.

Our consultants chatting about it are seeing issues throughout
US-EAST-1, some problems in -1A, -1B, -1C, -1D at least.  Earlier
reports that it might only be some fraction of those seem wrong.

1:02 PM PDT We continue to work to resolve the issue affecting EBS volumes
in a single availability zone in the US-EAST-1 region. The AWS Management
Console for EC2 indicates which availability zone is impaired.

EC2 instances and EBS volumes outside of this availability zone are
operating normally. Customers can launch replacement instances in the
unaffected availability zones but may experience elevated launch latencies
or receive ResourceLimitExceeded errors on their API calls, which are being
issued to manage load on the system during recovery. Customers receiving
this error can retry failed requests.

Just to remind people, Amazon availability zones are *not* universally
named. Your -1A is not necessarily the same as mine.

I.e. it could easily be only one AZ but appearing under every for different
accounts.

I don't have an iron-clad cite here but:
http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_can_I_make_sure_that_I_am_in_the_same_Availability_Zone_as_another_developer


Thanks,

As a point of information - my consulting company has many clients, many of whom have AWS presence in US-EAST-1, including the client I am at right now.

Our consultants chatting about it are seeing issues throughout US-EAST-1, some problems in -1A, -1B, -1C, -1D at least.  Earlier reports that it might only be some fraction of those seem wrong.

Not sure if anyone bothered to read my earlier message, but different
accounts see the same zones with different labels. So zone 'x' will be seen
as a by some, b by others,  c by some, etc.

We are experience a voice only issue with windstream at our location in
Troy, MI. Currently inbound or outbound calls on our Windstream trunks are
working for us. I am calling into windstream now, and as soon as I talk
with someone I will send another message out.

Thanks,

We're seeing Voice outage via a Windstream SIP trunk being delivered to Milwaukee in Windstream colo.

I'm also seeing multiple MPLS sites down in North-Central IL and South-Central Wisconsin.  All of it went down around 7:30am CDT.

Oh, and I almost forgot, our Sales rep indicated that there was a fiber cut somewhere that was affecting service throughout MI and WI, so that seems consistent with what's being seeing by a lot of people.

We out experiencing the following issues at our Columbus, OH facility:

Inbound Long-Distance and Local Calls - Calls are either routed to the wrong business, ring busy, or the call is completed with no audio at either end.

Outbound Long-Distance Calls - Calls seem to complete but no audio is heard on either end.

While these symptoms sound similar to reports from WI and MI, the Windstream rep we spoke with was not sure if the cut fiber was affecting OH as well so a ticket was opened.

Just got word from some higher-ups in Windstream that the Voice issue is supposedly on track for resolution around 15:00 CDT.

Consider me hopeful, yet highly skeptical.

Just did some testing from a PRI in our Downtown Chicago office and the
call connects however there is no audio.  This is also affecting a larger
office in Aurora, IL.  We hare not hearing anything like an ETR from our
contacts (mostly in the business side of Windstream), just the unhappiness
that goes with a major outage.

We seem to be suffering from dropped calls and audio issues as well.  Our SIP provider, Vitelity (based in Denver), is blaming it their upstream provider Paetec (who it appears is now part of Windstream, who I'd never heard of until today), so this issue seems to be affecting much more than the Midwest states as both us and Paetec are based in Portland Oregon.

Issue appears to be affecting service in several facilities here in Pennsylvania as well.  We are unable to make outgoing calls to Verizon customers.  Long distance service to other vendors is currently working.  Inbound calls from Verizon customers are successful, but outbound calls are not routing properly.  Windstream rep was not sure if this issue was related to the outage in the Midwest.  I was told not to expect an update on this until Friday.

Just did some testing from a PRI in our Downtown Chicago office and the call connects however there is no audio.  This is also affecting a larger office in Aurora, IL.  We hare not hearing anything like an ETR from our contacts (mostly in the business side of Windstream), just the unhappiness that goes with a major outage.

We out experiencing the following issues at our Columbus, OH facility:

Inbound Long-Distance and Local Calls - Calls are either routed to the wrong business, ring busy, or the call is completed with no audio at either end.

Outbound Long-Distance Calls - Calls seem to complete but no audio is heard on either end.

While these symptoms sound similar to reports from WI and MI, the Windstream rep we spoke with was not sure if the cut fiber was affecting OH as well so a ticket was opened.

Services are working again for us in Milwaukee.  The local paper has a 
story about 2 fiber cuts and a card failure causing the outage:

We out experiencing the following issues at our Columbus, OH facility:

Inbound Long-Distance and Local Calls - Calls are either routed to the wrong business, ring busy, or the call is completed with no audio at either end.

Outbound Long-Distance Calls - Calls seem to complete but no audio is heard on either end.

While these symptoms sound similar to reports from WI and MI, the Windstream rep we spoke with was not sure if the cut fiber was affecting OH as well so a ticket was opened.

At around 17:00 EDT our long distance came back up for both our Chicago
office and our Aurora office.  The call quality was at best 4 X 4 with some
echo and just a little muddy.  I expect that will improve and will check
things tomorrow morning.
   I am pleased with the level of information I was able to find on this
list as our friends at Windstream appeared to be just a little busy during
this time.  I am well aware of how little I like management  asking me
"How's it going" every few seconds (or so it seems) when things are broken
and I know I can be just a little short on real info at those times.

Don't have a node off gblx but I'm able to hit certain gblx device(s)
off Interxion DC traversing gblx-level3-ae.amsterdam1.Level3.net /
limelight-gw.ip4.tinet.net  just fine.

Do you have specifics?

Yeah, this is exactly why we terminated our contract with GBLX.

Frequent black holes in their MPLS network, and no traceroute capability to
be able to pinpoint the point of brokenness.

(Worse, it might even be the customer egress router on the other side
that's missing a return route(!), but you can't see whether it does inside
GBLX or not)

Some clarification: I've seen two types of MPLS in use: layer 2 and
layer 3.

Layer 2 MPLS (ex. Abovenet "long-haul" setups) behaves like what's
described above; you have no visibility into the MPLS network via a
traceroute -- even if done on the device where the circuit terminates;
thus naturally traceroute isn't going to see anything "in between".

Layer 3 MPLS (ex. AT&T "long-haul" setups) provides visibility as long
as the traceroute is done from the device where the circuit (Ethernet,
SONET, etc.) terminates.  In this case, traceroute from the terminating
device will provide visibility within the MPLS network.  An added bonus
is when the traceroute utility supports MPLS tag decoding.  :-)

I had to deal with this ordeal on a near-weekly basis at a past job
where both types of MPLS were in use simultaneously (separate circuits
of course).  L2 MPLS requires -- no, *demands* -- the carrier be on the
ball about monitoring their circuits and being able to very quickly,
while on the phone, trace everything back to a common point.

The only advice I can give regarding L2 MPLS is after every outage,
have a long phone conversation with the carrier and set expectations.
Do this every single time.  Get network engineers and your account rep
on the call.  I speak from experience when I say this is the only way
to get L2 MPLS providers to improve.

I am having some routing issues with my Frontier DSL service (residential)
and after speaking with technical support at Frontier, they confirmed they
are having a nationwide routing issue with no ETA currently on the fix.

Packet loss is intermittent regardless of destination.

Most of those zeroes have been zero for a long time.  The ITR isn?t well-maintained and I wouldn?t use the data as a primary source.

I am having some routing issues with my Frontier DSL service (residential) and after speaking with technical support at Frontier, they confirmed they are having a nationwide routing issue with no ETA currently on the fix.

 

Packet loss is intermittent regardless of destination.

Does anyone know when this cleared up?  I saw my email queues go down before
midnight Central, so if that's any indicator, there was some kind of
improvement.

Perhaps it's irony, but I'm unable to load that page.

Is there a quick summary you can provide?

We are the primary DNS servers for the ben.edu domain. We seem to be having an issue with an AT&T server that is responding  with incorrect A records for www.ben.edu<http://www.ben.edu> and ben.edu.

What it SHOULD be the response:

This appears to be affecting only iPhones and iPads on the AT&T network. Is anybody else having problems with this? Are there any AT&T people on this list that can help?

I didn't look beyond that, but it already looks fishy. Note that I used
ben.edu in the hostname on that manual GET request. When I tried it with
just the IP address, it said to go to searchremagnified.com.

Yeah, it appears to be some kind of placeholder site, like what Network Solutions uses.

What's strange is that the AT&T server appears to be handing out alternating responses:

208.91.197.132 doesn't have a PTR record associated with it, but a Whois query shows that it's owned by Confluence Networks. However, check out what happens when you go to that IP address:

I didn't look beyond that, but it already looks fishy. Note that I used ben.edu in the hostname on that manual GET request. When I tried it with just the IP address, it said to go to searchremagnified.com.

We are the primary DNS servers for the ben.edu domain. We seem to be having an issue with an AT&T server that is responding  with incorrect A records for www.ben.edu<http://www.ben.edu> and ben.edu.

What it SHOULD be the response:
nslookup www.ben.edu<http://www.ben.edu>
Server:         63.250.224.66
Address:        63.250.224.66#53

www.ben.edu<http://www.ben.edu>     canonical name = ben.edu.
Name:   ben.edu
Address: 38.100.120.100

What 12.127.17.83 is responding with:
> www.ben.edu<http://www.ben.edu>
Server:  tbru.br.rs.els-gms.att.net
Address:  12.127.17.83

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    www.ben.edu<http://www.ben.edu>
Address:  208.91.197.132

This appears to be affecting only iPhones and iPads on the AT&T network. Is anybody else having problems with this? Are there any AT&T people on this list that can help?

Hi,

So I tried in 3 different places:

Comcast residential service near San Jose, CA: 38.100.120.100
Multi-homed colo facility near Dallas, TX: 38.100.120.100
Multi-homed colo facility near London, UK: 208.91.197.32

Doing a bit of digging on the latter:

% dig +short @12.127.17.83 www.ben.edu ns

ns2432.ztomy.com.

Doing a google search on ztomy.com suggests that they provide malware/spyware/etc.

Looking at the address being returned (208.91.197.132):

Doing a google search on confluence networks suggests that they host a lot of bad stuff (e.g., 'high yield investment programs' which appear to be yet another form of Ponzi scheme).  I did see some suggestions of ztomy.com engaging in DNS cache poisoning, but no proof.

Given the inconsistent answers from the AT&T name server, one possibility is that AT&T's resolvers are under a Kaminsky-style DNS cache poisoning attack.  You might want to drop a note to the DNS-OARC (https://www.dns-oarc.net) dns-operations list -- I think there are probably some folks there from AT&T.

Regards,
-drc

Subject: [outages] EasyDNS issues?
Message-ID: <20121027134333.GA58009@icarus.home.lan>

I know EasyDNS is anycasted, so some of this troubleshooting work
doesn't narrow things down, but something is indeed going on.

Issue started roughly 2012/10/27 at 06:25 Pacific.

I'm guessing a DoS attack but that's speculative.

Message-ID: <CCB429E5.24B86%manderson@etc1.net>

Is anyone aware of any routing issues in the AT&T network today that just cleared about 20 minutes ago?

I have a customer that was experiencing issues routing to AT&T that was lasting several hours for them.  By time I was able
To dig into it they called back stating that it cleared so I was unable to get any information to try to locate a root cause of this
for them.

Thanks!

Primus seems to be experiencing a major outage in Toronto at the moment.
We are seeing all PRI circuits down and a complete loss of network
connectivity in their 10 Bay St. data centre.  All Primus support
numbers result in a congestion tone when dialed.  No mention of a major
outage on their support site:
http://businesssupport.primus.ca/network-status.php

 

Any further information out there?

 

Thanks,

I'm sure it's related, hearing reports of 18 foot waves on Lake Erie, snow in Columbus and elsewhere.  I've seen some photos of portions of NYC without power, etc?

I know areas of Northern Ohio have been having intermittent power outages as well.

Do hope everyone is safe from the storm.

We've got no news but are assuming it's Sandy coming to town.

Large section of Manhattan is without power currently.

Flooding too so the generator might be a little waterlogged.

I have no idea what is going on there. However, much of Manhattan is under water, under mandatory evacuation, and certainly no fuel deliveries are being made.

I am at my house in 07874. Considerable damage and lots of trees down.

We own datacenters in 07927, which still has utility power; and another in 07054 which is on generator with utility voltage roughly 14% high (about 550 volts).

We have equipment in 60 Hudson - as of now, it is still up.

We have lost one span of fiber between Morristown, NJ and Newark, NJ.

The situation is not great. I am grateful our centers are 100's of feet above sea level.

We've got no news but are assuming it's Sandy coming to town.

Because salt water and electricity are a bad combination, NY has shut down large sections of power as a precaution in preparation for expected storm surges that are likely to flood many of the underground facilities. These precautionary outages will very likely make it a whole lot easier to restore power much sooner after Sandy finishes pounding the area.

It's actually a surprisingly wise thing for them to have done. However, for it to work out well, they would have had to offline the back-up generators and disconnect the battery systems as well. I don't know to what extent that will have happened.

There are also unexpected outages. 111 8th was not in the area to be
intentionally powered down.

Info from Zayo:

The local power provider in the NY Market, ConEd, has intentionally
de-energized power systems in the New York metropolitan area to reduce
system damage as salt water has entered the underground infrastructure.
Additionally, power outages have been observed in the Newark metropolitan
area affecting the Zayo facility at 165 Halsey.   All Zayo facilities that
have sustained a loss of commercial power are currently operating normally
on generator backup, and refueling arrangements are being made for all Zayo
owned generators at this time to ensure continuous operation of Zayo
facilities and equipment.  A current readout by site of our current
generator runtime is as follows:



    - *60 Hudson (NY)*
         - 1st Floor MMR (Meet Me Room) 18 Hours of generator backup, with
         additional fuel onsite to replenish the generator
         - 12th Floor has 30+ hours or generator back up
         - 15th and 19th Colocation Floor 30+ hours or generator back up
         which is provided by the building

**Fuel supplier has tankers inside the city of New York to deliver fuel to
Zayo when necessary.*



    - *111 8th Ave (NY)*
         - Has 90,000 gallons of fuel, which is able to provide up to 4
         days of power



    - *165 Halsey (NJ)*
         - 5th Floor has 17+ hours of generator backup
         - 10th Floor has 30+ hours of generator backup


At this point, we are experiencing multiple fiber cuts as a result of the
storm which has resulted in service interruptions to transport services in
the Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York markets.

XO reports they're on generators at 111 8th Ave and are still seeing issues to that data center.

Internap also has big issues, likely to go dead ~3:30-5:30a EDT 10/30/2012: 
http://pastebin.com/d9espQRw

Init7 reports issues, but still has connectivity to NYIIX or Equinix NYC: 
http://www.init7.net/en/status/&ticket=6088

Meanwhile, light reading on what folks did to gear up for Sandy:
http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2012/10/29/northeast-data-centers-brace-for-sandy/

It'll be interesting to see what mattered and what didn't.

Apparently the entire 3rd floor minus Level3 is out. Telx lost conEd power
around 7:37P, and we saw everything shut down around 10:57P. Currently
claiming something wrong between building gensets and power infrastructure
on floor 3. No updates since 12:30AM (all EST). Anyone know more?

Understand - 111 8th is a multi-tenant building, with tens and tens of power systems and generator systems, etc. Just because one guy is up does not infer another is down, and vice versa.

I had to summarize for an internal resource in the last few minutes, figure I would share:
--

Of our three datacenters, this is what we saw:

Parsippany 1 (OCT) - The worst we saw here was several sub-second power hits. UPS's held without problem, and we did not transfer to generator at all yet.

Parsippany 2 (WBR) - Transferred to generator at about 7:55 PM EST as a precautionary measure due to ongoing utility power hits. However, shortly after transfer, utility voltage went to 0 on all phases; around 10p power returned, but abnormally high (seeing about 550 volts on 480 volt bus). We remain on generator with at least 60 hours of fuel left on site.

Cedar Knolls 1 (MMU) - Briefly transferred to generator around 7:10, then back to utility. We then force transferred to generator around 8pm and stayed until this morning. Returned to utility and all systems are normal.

Fuel trucks are stationed at our facilities as of noon yesterday, and remain. Across all centers, consumption would be - in worst case - around 250 gallons per hour. We have 6,880 on site in generator tanks (27 hours), and additional 12,500 gallons (50 hours) on site available for transfer as needed, for a total of run time of 77 hours. However, we are only consuming fuel at one site right now (WBR, rate of 43 gal/hr).

We have accommodated several customers by allowing them to use our conference rooms and some offices, mainly because they lost power at their buildings, lost access to their buildings, or generators ran out of fuel.

There has been no service interruption of any sort to any of our datacenter customers, as of this writing.

We lost one span of fiber optics between MMU and 165 Halsey, Newark (NWR), network healed in less than 1 second. It was imperceptible. That was early though, yesterday afternoon.

We have sales people onsite who are actively taking sales calls, and there is a measurable amount of customers moving equipment into our facilities as I write this. Many are moving equipment from offices with no power and no ETR in sight. We have electricians onsite to help accommodate.

The facilities department has been manning all locations around the clock.

All sites remain accessible by road. There was never a situation where you could not over the last 24 hours.

We have no equipment in 111 8th, so I cannot offer any telemetry there. However, our gear in 60 Hudson St (Tel-X 9th floor) is still online.

We saw no interruption at 165 Halsey, except for some very brief utility hits. UPS's held.

We are seeing hundreds, if not thousands, of DSL / T1 / T3 / Ethernet customers down - presumably mostly power loss on the CPE. We lost our connection to Covad, presumably they have gear in a building which lost power.

We have seen substantial interruption to the cellular networks; in many cases, ATT Wireless (who NAC uses) is unable to complete a call. In certain areas, there is no signal at all.

Where I live, in 07874 (Byram), many roads are impassable and most everyone does not have power. Trees are down everywhere. I heard that a Byram squad car had a tree land on it while responding to a call. Schools are closed, Halloween has been "rescheduled" according to our governor. My cable is down, cable modem is down, POTS service is out - yet I still have xDSL (loop by Verizon, IP by NAC) and I run on that successfully. I am unable to get any ATT cell service at my house (usually at least three bars). I am on generator at my house, consuming about 2 gal/hour (propane), with a little over 500 gallons left.

That is all I have.

This is the road leading to the Byram Police Dept - I took this earlier this morning:

This is typically what Northern NJ looks like:

Ouch, and RE: Covad/Megapath lines, in NY they have been lighting up
our email with outage reports, they all end up with a status of:

Description:
We are currently experiencing a service interruption due to equipment
failure at the NYCMNYBS central office in New York, NY.

UPDATE: Due to hurricane storm Sandy, the city is under full state of
emergency as roads and bridges are closed. Services will remain down
during duration of storm as no dispatches can be made. NOC will send
further update whenever there is change in condition.

Also reports  AC2 transatlantic cable down and loss of connectivity to NY
based servers.
Along with reports on Ausnog about all the fun with the large DCs in
Manhattan going to gennie power, diesel pumps being flooded and failing
'cos the tanks are in the basement...

Will be a massive clearup not just for the IT folks, Subways and road
tunnels flooded so getting about will be challenging for a while.

"The flooding has submerged and destroyed the site's diesel pumps and
is preventing fuel from being pumped to the generators on the
mezzanine level. The available fuel reserves on the mezzanine level
are estimated to support customer loads for approximately 5-7 hours.
Once this fuel supply has been exhausted the generator will no longer
be able to sustain operation and critical customer power loads will be
lost. The building itself is being evacuated and no remote hands
support will be available to assist in any equipment shutdown."

Unless I 'm off, US AC-2 landing station is in Bellport, New York,
while another is in Tuckerton, NJ. From I gather both areas have heavy
storm damage since they were on the north side of Sandy's land fall.
They are reporting a storm surge at 13 feet above flood stage in NYC.

Can you run a traceroute, would be interested in seeing the path its
traversing. Just curious.

Are you configured properly to fail over to their LA site?

I've been seeing some issues with one-way audio on origination with them 
toay, but no hard outage for sure. The one-way audio issue was far worse 
until we manually flipped to using the LA site as primary instead of the 
NY site.

We use VoIP Innovations and all of our DIDs with network code BW (bandwidth.com) ring "all circuits are busy". VoIP Innovations tells us it is a NYC outage and we have to wait it out. But based on the information you just provided it sounds like VoIP Innovations dropped the ball switching over to the LA proxy.

It's hard to be more vague than that, but I can report that it's

FYI, I had a ticket opened for the occasional one-way audio on outbound 
calls.. they finally replied and said that it's due to the hurricane. 
Which seems odd, since we're entirely central.. if it was incoming I could 
understand it.. but for outbound I'd expect it to be easily fixed. *sigh*. 
Time to route outbound via Vitelity for awhile..

Also reports  AC2 transatlantic cable down and loss of connectivity to NY based servers.
Along with reports on Ausnog about all the fun with the large DCs in Manhattan going to gennie power, diesel pumps being flooded and failing 'cos the tanks are in the basement...

Will be a massive clearup not just for the IT folks, Subways and road tunnels flooded so getting about will be challenging for a while.

Hi Carl,


We saw your inquiry regarding AC2 on twitter and wanted to clarify the rumor you heard. I?m providing you a company statement below, which will hopefully help provide a little more context.


Level 3 Statement Regarding AC2

We made extensive preparations in advance of the storm and have experienced no major service disruptions. All of our subsea cable systems are operating normally. We have experienced a minor fiber cut to one of our diversely routed, secondary backhaul lines which provides connectivity to our AC2 Cable Landing Station, and our technicians are currently working to repair it as quickly as possible. Few customers were affected because most traffic was rerouted through redundant lines. And again, the AC2 subsea cable itself is operating normally.


Aside from that, I hope that you're having a great evening and that all else is going well.

Best,
Jon Paul

We lost a Sidera 10G NYC-BOS wave through Western Massachusetts about the
same time and it sounds like it is parallel to your TDS circuit. It's been
down overnight.

Sidera NOC guys are flat out on the phones this morning, no specific
details available, but it looked like one of their DWDM regen nodes on the
route lost its generator and utility power. Could even be more than one
site on the route, not sure. Lots of carnage closer to NYC.

Have not been able to get much information on this, except a tweet confirming the outage.
Started about 2:47 Eastern on the 30th.

Traceroute in to one of my static ip dies in NYC. Suspect this is storm/power related?

Hi Wallace,

Due to Hurricane Sandy TDS customers in NH are experiencing Internet outage.

TDS has a double failure on two diverse routes of our 10G network.   One connection point in New York City is in a building that has no power and is flooded and a second connection point is on alternate route that has a fiber cut on a line just outside of New York City. 

TDS has escalated this issue with our interconnect carriers and Point of Presence (POP) vendors, they are aware of our issue and working to fix them, but as we all know these are extraordinary circumstances for New York City residents and contractors alike who we need to assist us.  

If either of these routes is repaired service will be restored in what we refer to as Simplex mode (one of two optional routes.)   TDS was in Simplex mode following the storm and the second route dropped yesterday afternoon to cause the full outage.  

TDS Long Distance is affected in some areas as well. Landline customers in NH do have dial tone and can make local calls.  Customers on IP phone services do not have phone service as it requires the IP/data connection and should use alternate phone lines.  When service is restored we recommend customers reboot their ManagedIP phones.

TDS does not have an ETA at this time.   We will provide another update at 3:00 CST today.  In these unprecedented times we all need to be patient and await the necessary repairs.   Please bear with us. 

TDS Internet customers do not need to call in to report their outages.  

Best Regards,
TDS Telecom IP Network Operations

We had some fiber go down yesterday at 3:33PMEDT. Last I heard from Windstream
(was City Signal, Cavalier, Paetec, now Windstream) was a cut in "Delaware" and
a tech en route to shoot with a 6:15PM ETA. This was at 5:30PM and I haven't
heard anything since. Support seems to be in infinite hold mode.

I know there's a lot going on but has anyone here been in touch with Windstream
regarding cuts in the area?

The backhaul in Long Island went down (29th, 22.40 UTC) but has been
repaired (31st, 02.40 UTC) .. this was only one backhaul path so not
everyone was affected.

We're in west central Florida using Windstream (Paetec) voice, and are 
unable to make long distance calls at this time from multiple PRIs.

Support ticket system is barely functioning-- taking 2+ minutes per page 
load, with sporadic timeouts.  I get the feeling we're not alone.

We had Tollfree's down out here in SF Bay Area. First reported about
6:15p PST, we are up as of 9a PST. When calling support at 9p last night
it took 50 mins to get thru- 
Our PRIs stayed up though

They have confirmed they are having issues, they have posted to
olmnews.comthey are reporting they are on generators but they have not
said why the
network is down, my guess is outside resources, wasn't sure anyone else had
other news.

Hey guys,

Curious if anyone is seeing SIP service outages beyond the bandwidth issues from yesterday. I know call centric is having issues still, but is anyone experiencing any other disconnects?

Cheers,

Call centric is fubared more or less. I will be surprised if they have any
customers left after this (no redundancy) and the recent DDOS.

All issues we were seeing with one-way audio on outbound calls have 
cleared up. No new reports today.

I cannot say if people who have numbers from Bandwidth in the affected 
geographic areas have working numbers again yet..

TATA was down for a bit in NYC (NJ GSX was up), Reliance is down,
Telia is down, Telstra just came back up, BICS was down for a bit.
Hypercube was down for a little bit out of the NY pop but their
Atlanta and LA switches worked fine for us.

Have not been able to get much information on this, except a tweet confirming the outage.
Started about 2:47 Eastern on the 30th.

Traceroute in to one of my static ip dies in NYC. Suspect this is storm/power related?

TDS Internet Update #4 for Super Storm Sandy - Oct. 31 1:12 p.m. CST

10G connection from Contoocook NH to NY City has been restored! We are in Simplex mode on one of our two routes as described in earlier post. Thank you for your understanding during this outage. We do still have other markets with some isolated outages, but things are looking good now with this major connection restored.

We're seeing intermittent 20 second post-dial delay and occasional dropped calls outbound through Dash/Inetwork/Bandwidth, starting 30 minutes ago. We just moved outbound away from them.

We use them out of Denver and Atlanta and are not seeing any problems or 
call delays.

We are seeing tremendous post-dial delay issues. We emailed them as such.
It's been kind of up and down since the storm actually. Calls, when they
complete, seem to stay up, but then again customers may just not be
complaining as loudly because they are aware of the circumstances...

Hello All,

I have updated tracker w/ names of the volunteers who are willing to
help. In my eyes they are unsung heroes who are willing to share their
time, talents, and energy to help specially as times as such.

If interested, please e-mail me your contact information & the nature
of help you're willing to render and I'll be happy to post your
information to tracker roster.

For more information, please visit:
http://tracker.outages.org/reports/index/?c=12&sw=-77.036366,38.895112&ne=-74.005973,40.714353

As part of my gratitude and appreciation, I will be giving out
(outages.org) t-shirts to those who are willing to post their name(s)
to tracker roster.

If I can be of any assistance (w/ clean up, racking/un-racking,
pulling cables, routing, switching, wifi, monitoring, etc) I'll be
happy to help provided mother nature lets me through since I'm located
in southern california. Just let me know.

The best I can do is tell you how much I appreciate your continued
support not only with outages.org but during times of crisis such as
this. We hope we can continue to demonstrate to others that we value
everyone's help/support and that we use it wisely to provide the help
that people in crisis need.


With sincere appreciation,


regards,
/virendra
