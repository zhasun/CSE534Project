Seeing weird issues as we did 2 weeks ago...anyone else?  This time, it appears to make it through Cogent's network but dies in Charters (unlike 2 weeks ago when traceroutes died in Cogent's network).

Subject: [outages] Att BVOIP Outage
Message-ID: <CAMaTcxVFxmxatxiL7r-3wPJ9XkRoiVTyGcLsd798Jxa-VT-K7A@mail.gmail.com>

As of about 9am CST we started getting duplicate ISDN sessions for all of
our inbound calls on an IP FLEX circuit from ATT, outbound calls are fine,
but inbound connect and give an error "Caller is unreachable at this time".
Speaking with ATT, they are aware of the issue and have reports of issues
in the mid west (we are in Illinois). No master ticket and no ETTR as of
yet, but supposedly they are working on the issue. Just a heads up.

A cursory check shows that our instances in US-EAST-1C and D are

Just for reference, I'm directly connected to edge9 in Dallas and have not seen anything or heard any reports from our clients. I'm checking one destination which (based on PTR records) appears to traverse edge4 and am not currently seeing any loss to the destination.

Message-ID: <20120410211741.GA64306@goku.i.pumpky.net>

Anyone else having Google DNS problems? Google DNS appears to be very,
very spotty from our site. Coming from prefix 69.36.128.0/20. I can
ping the IPs, but DNS lookups mostly timeout. Haven't been able to
replicate from other sites/prefixes. Haven't been able to find a service
status page for it either.

A little slow on the trace from my side but seems to be responding to me as expected from all 3 locations I tested.  Coming from 72.165.142.0/24 173.248.152.0/25 and 75.151.89.0/24.  Seems to slow down when it hits the Google network from Comcast and Centurylink.

Remember that it's anycasted and others aren't going to get directed to the same servers that you are (unless they're in the same area as you are, network wise). It's probably a localized issue.

Subject: [outages] SF South Bay: chronic latency/packet loss between Abovenet/Comcast at Great Oaks
Message-ID: <20120411014434.GA75884@icarus.home.lan>

There's an issue I've been tracking for a few months now pertaining to a
network link between Abovenet and Comcast which appears to become
saturated (or impacted negatively in some way) at nearly the same time
every night, and lasts for numerous hours, then ceases -- on a
near-daily basis (no exaggeration).

Latency and packet loss occur during this time, with latency hitting
150ms (sometimes higher), with packet loss ranging from 0.5% to 2.0%.
I've been storing periodic traceroutes/mtrs for over a month showing
this problem, and been tracking start/end times as well.

Thankfully I own devices/have connectivity on both ends (src and dst,
thus can provide mtrs/traceroutes from both directions.  Analysis so
far, done by myself as well as senior network techs at my co-lo
provider, confirms this issue is with a link between Abovenet/Comcast,
likely within the San Jose Great Oaks POP (which I'm familiar with as
part of my job).

I opened up a ticket on DSLR/BBR's Comcast Direct forum (which only
Comcast employees can respond to/view tickets for) over a month ago.
Someone has been viewing it, but nobody has replied except me.

I've since made the issue public, where (of course) the general Internet
community does not quite understand how peering arrangements/contracts
work (people think that any company who has a contract with Abovenet can
report issues, but that is simply not the case; you must be a POC for
the transport to report issues with it), nor do they understand how a
co-lo provider changing route preferencing can impact the provider
financially (based on billing metrics, etc.).  My co-lo provider is very
strict with their routing policies, and it has to do with financial
reasons that are their own business, not mine.

The public thread is here, which also includes start/end times,
traceroutes (both directions), and so on.  I update it every day when
the issue happens, and ~90% of the time edit my posts when the issue
ends.

http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r27085601-SF-South-Bay-Chronic-IP-network-latency-nightly

Anyway, all the technical details aside:

Is there anyone on this list who works for Comcast who can contact me
off-list who is willing to investigate this and drive it to completion?

An alternative would be for someone to contact me off-list with the name
or Email address of someone (or division) who handles issues like this
at Comcast.  I'd love for Abovenet to get involved, but I have no
contractual obligation to them.  (If there is an Abovenet individual who
is willing to investigate this "pro bono" per se, that would be
awesome, but I imagine such is often above one's pay grade).

Hi Jeremy,

When the issue was raised a week or two ago there seemed to be a route
announcement issue for 72.20.98.67.  When your colo provider changed
their policy did they update filters with their upstream?

Cheers, -ren, who will confirm there is no congestion with Abovenet on
the port in SJC to Comcast.

Hi Ren,

The issue with my co-lo pertaining to route announcements has actually
been "dealt with", meaning "this is just how it is".  I'm wondering if I
can go into details without violating contractual obligations, hmm.
Yes, I imagine I can, because it becomes quite obvious if I provide
traceroutes from both directions, and that's public knowledge.

It appears that my co-lo (BAIS) doesn't actually adjust route
announcements on a per-IP basis, but they internally have a hashing
algorithm in place where on a per-IP basis different addresses utilise
different network paths.  I still have an open ticket with their senior
networking engineer about this, who has been somewhat "careful" in what
he tells me, but so far I've basically gotten confirmation that this is
indeed how they do their load-balancing for customers to balance out
network traffic between all of their peering providers (Level 3,
Abovenet, Cogent, and 2-3 others).

I can provide those examples (to/from different IPs) if you want to see
them, but that is a separate matter.  There still seems to be a problem
between Abovenet/Comcast.  Alternate links/paths through my co-lo (e.g.
BAIS/Cogent) show no problems on the ingress or egress path -- the
common path seems to be Abovenet/Comcast when there are problems.

This is what's presently happening right now:

A little PTR would help see more clearly, but I believe I see asymmetry here. Also interesting is the ultimate hop at 0% loss in one of those samples. 

Feel free to put me in my place, but please do so on -discuss.

Subject: [outages] SF South Bay: chronic latency/packet loss between Abovenet/Comcast at Great Oaks

Message-ID: <20120411043304.GA78572@icarus.home.lan>

I choose not to do DNS resolution in mtr because otherwise the terminal
width required to see FQDNs has to be >76 characters, which often upsets
mailing list folks.  (This for example is one of the few lists on which
I top-post)

I'm not so concerned with the packet loss -- for example in the 2nd mtr
set I showed, the loss only seems to happen at routers, which is almost
certainly the result of ICMP prioritisation.

But the latency is a definite problem and is easily noticeable across
SSH, Remote Desktop, and any other TCP service (i.e. the latency shown
is not a result of ICMP prioritisation).  src/dst IPs on both sides are
actual servers/boxes, not routers.

But you're absolutely right -- asymmetric routing is in place here,
which means that everyone has to work together, and simultaneously, to
really figure out where the problem is.  I can only do so much when I
have little to no visibility into things (e.g. if I had access to BAIS
and Abovenet and Level 3 and Comcast routers I could figure out where
the problem is... ;-) )

I'm currently engaged in a conversation with Comcast engineers about
this issue.  (Seems my DSLR post got proper attention)

So far the statement is that they've looked at the interface for the
Abovenet/Comcast peering point in question, and although it's being
used/busy, it's not oversaturated.  They also pointed out that the only
announcements they see for 72.20.96.0/19 are via Level 3 and Cogent,
thus the issue is likely to be on my co-lo providers' side (e.g. the
Level 3 <-> BAIS link).  route-views also confirms the same thing, as
does my place of work (who has peering with Abovenet natively).

I have a ticket open with my co-lo provider to investigate this ordeal.

If this does turn out to be a problem with their Level 3 link being
saturated chronically, then I owe Comcast/Abovenet an apology (welcome
to one of the complexities with asymmetric routing!), and I'm going to
have to make some decisions with regards to co-location and so on,
because the chronic nature of this problem is unacceptable for myself as
well as my customers.

I've checked from multiple networks and recursive name servers. It seems all of the authoritative name servers for sun.com are not responding to requests. Is everyone else seeing this as well?

Traces look the same to all sun.com name servers I get from glue data via a.gtld-servers.net.

Following up to my own post (in bad habit):

Can some folks here who have peering with Abovenet (preferably with a
full routing table) verify that you see an announcement for
72.20.96.0/19 (AS7151) coming via AS6461 (Abovenet)?

I've confirmed this is the case at my workplace, but I want extra
eyes/verification.

Thanks.

Oracle did disable the sun.com domain (although not at the DNS server
level) close to a year ago.  It lasted a few hours before they discovered a
large number of other websites stopped working as a result, including parts
of java.com.

I doubt they would have made the same mistake twice, which leads me to
guess this is probably an outage rather than a deliberate shutdown.

  Scott.

Same here.  One of their four DNS servers, ns1.sun.com (192.18.128.11),
doesn't have Cogent in the path (see
http://bgptables.merit.edu/assum.php?z=&as=11479#prefixTables), but it makes
no difference.  None of the traceroutes I perform hit a 192.18.x.x address.

I am seeing this also.    No DNS response from  any of the 4 DNS server IPs.

I guess there's no need for anyone to do this.  I completely forgot that
Abovenet has a looking glass.

They absolutely see a route announcement for 72.20.96.0/19 from AS7151,
including from mpr4.sjc7.us.above.net (keep reading):

Per http://lg.above.net/lg.cgi --

So what Comcast's "backbone team" told me appears to be incorrect (we're
all human), or there are route filters being applied, or they don't get
a full routing table from Abovenet -- unknown which.  I'm still talking
to them about that, but probably won't get an answer until later
tomorrow.

I still have a ticket open with my co-lo provider to investigate the
Level 3 link they have.  That's just as much of a possibility of an
saturation point as the Abovenet/Comcast link is.

Abovenet's LG also offers ping capability, so I should be able to use
that as a way to narrow down/confirm if the problem is there or with the
Level 3<->BAIS link.  Will find out tomorrow...

Looks like 192.18.43.12 (ns8.sun.com) is accessible for me now, but the
other three aren't.

Same here.  One of their four DNS servers, ns1.sun.com (192.18.128.11),
doesn't have Cogent in the path (see
http://bgptables.merit.edu/assum.php?z=&as=11479#prefixTables), but it makes
no difference.  None of the traceroutes I perform hit a 192.18.x.x address.

Their web looking glass isn't enough for this purpose. You need to see at
least
- what communities are on the route
- what the outbound policy is on the session
- what the inbound policy is on the other side

All you have here is 'route in table'.

I still have a ticket open with my co-lo provider to investigate the

This is what you should have done in the first place; deal with the people
you pay for service and push them to do their job.

Subject: [outages] Intermittent packet loss Level3 Dallas
Message-ID: <CACBmxzfBAHSKjHrMo3wEzFbnXbBqQHMy4RFZFbmspVC6TbsOkQ@mail.gmail.com>

I've been noticing intermittent packet loss on our Level3 IP service
in Dallas.  It usually happens for about 5 minutes with ~10% packet
loss on our link to Level3 in Dallas.

I was told they did some maintenance last night (bgp session did drop)
but it has still been occurring.

Has anyone else been seeing this?

Jeremy,

That your collocation provider is a) load-balancing by hashing traffic
between two disparate transit ASes (with very different interprovider
connectivity, performance characteristics, ...), on a per-IP basis b)
running its transit ports hot, by its own admission... does not
inspire confidence in its ability to deliver reliable service.

At this juncture, it seems like we've sufficiently beaten this horse
and established that there are no known issues between the backbone
providers you've called out in this thread, from the information
provided to date.

The good news about the Bay Area is that it's a competitive
marketplace, with no shortage of competent providers selling
collocation and IP.  Probably off-topic for discussion on this list,
though I'd be happy to recommend some offline if you're coming up
short.

Adam,

Sorry, but it doesn't help.  The recurring latency I've reported is
quite real.  As I said, I have months of mtrs/traceroutes from both
directions showing this problem.  Asymmetric routing does not/can not
explain the chronic high latency seen at roughly the same times nearly
every day.  I wish it was ICMP prioritisation (I really do).

I have done as much work as I can on documenting the recurring nature of
the problem, where its seen (either between Level 3 and AS7151, or
between Abovenet and Comcast), when it starts, and when it ends.  As I
am the customer on *both ends* (src and dst), the fact that I'm getting
no where is preposterous.  Given that I do not have access to Abovenet,
Comcast, Level 3, or my co-lo providers' routers, I'm forced to rely on
the competency of others.

Nobody has "beaten this horse" -- the horse is still there, blocking the
road, its corpse rotting and festering, affecting network traffic.  Who
hauls it into the road every day from roughly 17:00 to 21:00 PDT is
unknown.  Instead, all that's happened is folks focusing on the
asymmetric aspect of routing, and with my co-lo provider's choice to
siphon certain IPs through certain routes.

As for the Bay Area having "no shortage of competent providers selling
co-location": let me know when that happens.  All I've seen so far is
complete and total incompetence on the parts of co-lo providers (not
only our current but our previous as well), transit and peering

The issue is a local problem in Cogent ring around the North branch Chicago
river that now is also involving ComEd. According to Cogent, customers
affected are only those near the north branch Chicago river near the loop.
Can anyone in Cogent confirm this?

It's not just limited to Cogent either.  Reliance Globalcom is
experiencing a seemingly related issue.

Adam, I can see the Civic Opera building from my office, its right in front
of me, but i'm on the other side of the river.

My ticket with Cogent was updated and a faulty fiber link underneath the
river is what is causing the outage.

Outage appears to be related to a manhole fire:

There is a large fiber cut in Los Angeles affecting many providers at this time that's been going on since earlier today. I'm also being affected by this between LA and Dallas and seeing latency on other networks in the LA area as a result of congestion due to decreased capacity.

Looks like we have Teleworkers in AZ and NV impacted by this.   All are Cox Cable customers, and we saw the issue start for the users about 11AM ET today.  Cox has confirmed an outage and is looking at a "fiber cut" as root cause.   (They aren't providing anything definitive yet).

partial fiber cut at approximately 42 km from the Tustin, CA
site.   It has been reported that the partial cut appears to have been caused by a
billboard crew who was boring in the area.  The splicing crew is onsite still awaiting the arrival of the digging equipment;
however, no ETA was available at this time

Thanks!

That wouldn't explain why things are *still* down.  The whole idea
behind a protected path is that it's a failover path; primary path goes
down, protected path takes over.  Depending on the medium there's a few
milliseconds of downtime (talking about SONET rings here).  So this
would make me ask: why are things still down?

If a protected path was already in use (re: fibre cut), then that would
make me ask: why hasn't anyone failed back to the primary path?

I'm inclined to think there's a single carrier involved here, and
possibly who lacks redundancy (i.e. both paths are shoved through the
same conduit/fibre bundle which has been cut).  There's no point in
bothering with redundancy if there's a SPoF anywhere within the
topology.

But like everything else, this is all speculation.

We saw the issues on the AS209 backbone as well from our vantage point here in Seattle but we also show a circuit we have down (that rides Qwest) between Yakima, WA and Spokane, WA.   The outage corresponds to the IP issues so I would think that it is probably the same cut affecting both the wave we are seeing as out and the IP issues (which mostly seem better now).

Thanks,
John @ AS11404 here in Seattle.

On Twitter, LastCenturyLink told me its a fiber cut in Spokane, WA.

Did anyone else see IPv6 access to www.cogentco.com and ipv6.cogentco.com

Perhaps more was down, but I'm just monitoring the v6 side of that site

Comcast appears to have had some sort of outage isolating portions of their southeast michigan network from chicago.

It just recovered itself when I was about to post this note.

Looks like the outage I had at home was related to this. Times are 
consistent with what I noticed. I could ping their gateway so it was 
clear this wasn't just a "modem needs reboot":

http://www.cruzio.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=108&Itemid=388

"As for Wednesday 4/18 at 10:40PM, some of our DSL customers are part of 
an internet outage and will not be able to get online. We are working 
with our upstream provider to get this resolved as soon as possible. We 
do not have an ETA on when this will be fixed.

UPDATE: as of 1:09am on 4/19 this issue has been resolved by our 
upstream provider.

UPDATE: as of 7am on 4/19 several of our DSL customers are still 
reporting they can't get online. We are working with our upstream 
provider to get this resolved, and do not have an ETA yet.

UPDATE: as of 9am on 4/19 this issue appears to have been resolved"

Sounds like based on time, this could have been a cause of the major cBeyond issues this morning too.

Same thing here, took out our DS-3.  Qwest/CenturyLink is aware of the 
issue with no ETA.  Saying it's a core routing problem.

Seeing issues across a lot of our customers on Integra, including a branch office of ours.  Anyone know what's up?  We have a ticket open, but getting the usual sludge and no ETA.

Is anyone still dealing with this outage?  My office uses Qwest as its ISP
and we're still having issues to some sites. Specifically, Google's auth
server, accounts.google.com.

http://pastebin.com/AprVPJ5W

We seem to be unable to get past 64.233.174.204 or 64.233.174.206.  I was
in touch w/ Qwest/Centurylink support this morning and they're saying that
things are all patched up on their end and that the fault lies with some
other carriers.

I don't know, geographically, where USA Digital is located, or at which POP

To be entirely accurate, they have 7 locations. All in LAS. There are two networks for "house" pipe. I'd call one "cheap" and the other "good" blends of transit.

All:

We are seeing some routing issues with our CenturyLink connection in
Atlanta. If I am our peering router with CL, a traceroute sourced from
one interface works while another fails.

// works

Is anyone else experiencing issues with CenturyLink? We have a ticket
opened but there are no updates at this time.

Our colo in Atlanta (Peak10) had to disconnect from CenturyLink due to this
same issue. We're routing to them via XO.

CenturyLink has a number of different networks, so it would be helpful
if people would identify the AS they are talking about when they say
"CenturyLink".

Both sides seem to be blaming the other.  Is anyone routing via 
above.net or he.net seeing similar issues out west?

Hi Rob,

Thanks for the quick response.  Sorry for the confusion, the information 
I was provided at first was a little cloudy.  We also use GT-T/Packet 
Exchange and they're pointing this at above.net.

Here's the response we received from PKX/GT-T regarding the routing 
anomaly we're experiencing:

 From LAX core device the routes goes to abovenet for both the ip 
address and dies within the above net network.
We will investigate with abovenet and update you shortly.

cr1.lax1#traceroute 108.171.183.75

If they have not yet opened a ticket with you, this leads me to believe 
there's a problem elsewhere and we're being given the run-around.

The particular trace above is to one of our off-site boxes at rackspace.

This is an issue that seems to be impacting multiple networks and 
regions, so I'm not entirely convinced there's not something more going on.

For example, besides the IP referenced above, our 205.134.0.0 subnets 
are also failing.  I pulled this trace from Above.net's looking glass:

Rob,

Thanks for getting back to us.  You are indeed correct, the problem does 
appear to be inside the Corporate Colocation network.  Their NOC has 
been insisting this was upstream and the routing issues we're seeing as 
a result incorrectly implicated peers along the way.  I apologize for 
wasting your time, and again thank you for troubleshooting and responses.

-Erik

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Was anyone aware of any issues that might have affected DNS resolution for some .gov domains (specifically grants.gov) on Tuesday 4/24 around 3-5pm US Central Time?  We weren't alerted to the problem until 4:25pm, and things started working again around 4:45pm, so we didn't have time to really troubleshoot.  By the time we saw the ticket and the like, all we had time to do was verify that DNS was failing for us from AS103 and a couple of other DNS testing sites like kloth.net with the "no servers could be reached" error.  Users report that DNS resolution was working though from their cellular data networks as well as the public Wi-Fi in the Burger King across the street from their offices, so it does not appear to have been a universal outage. 

Anecdotally, our users report that there may have been similar errors with nsf.gov and nih.gov earlier that day, but we have no actual data on that.  We also found some earlier issues noted with .gov such as the one mentioned at <http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Connectivity-and-Modem-Help/Re-Comcast-DNS-issue-gov-site-not-resolving/td-p/1261913>.  However, we have been unable to find any actual external verification of our exact issue, which would be useful since we had a few grant proposals get rejected because our researchers missed their deadline.

Obviously there are any number of possible causes for this problem, and the grants.gov people seem to be having issues escalating our tickets with them to the group that would have a better chance of investigating from their end (and of course the actual problem could have been outside both of our spheres of influence).  

Thanks for any information that can be shared!
