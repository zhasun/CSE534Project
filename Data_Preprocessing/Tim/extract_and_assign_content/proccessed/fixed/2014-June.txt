A routing issue in a Seattle core router impacting 14 network nodes 
serving Comcast circuits from Portland to the Canadian border are having 
issues.

No hardware failures have been identified.

The issue appears to be exclusively layer 2 routing.

Comcast has, of course, engaged their highest level engineers who are 
presently "all-hands-on-deck" working to resolve this issue.

There is no firm ETR as of yet.

Does anyone see a Pac-West outage? DID's are failing... tried to call 
(213) 325-0000 on their site also and it just hangs up.

Thanks

Sorry for the lack of followup.

Service was down for us from 1600 (on the dot) until 2035. We are a 
customer of a customer so we don't have direct access to Comcast for 
details.

One of our POPs is at a K20 network site supported by Comcast EPL. They 
dropped off around 1700 and came back around the same time.

Update from Pac West as of 6:30 pm Pacific time today:

Please see most recent notice from upper management regarding the current
outage:

The commercial power was cut off this morning and the batteries did not
hold long enough for the generator to come on and take over the load.  (we
will investigate and replace the batteries ASAP)

The network team have been there all day building the network components
back and bringing it back online

Unfortunately, when the network went down one router did not come back up.
The team has switched out the router and is now building the connections
back between the new router and the network.

Don?t have an ETA yet, but appear to be getting down the home stretch.

Sounds like a single-router deployment model with no onsite (like) spares ? if so, they could have swapped in the routers/line cards and restored service much more quickly?.I wonder if the router that didn?t come back up was one of the Cisco memory-afflicted ones.

I guess I am very surprised there seems to be little redundancy in their
systems. Ideally a second physical facility but I'd settle for redundant
routers at this point.

I believe the power outage was scheduled power shut off at one wilshire/624 s. Grand
None of my equipment went down in that building.

Nor ours.

Our BGP peering session with Pacwest there bounced but has been back up
and stable since about 8:40 AM PDT, with their usual announced prefixes.

We have some PacWest TDM/PRI that is still down, so this doesn't seem to
be an IP router affected, nor necessarily at One Wilshire.  I suspect
"router" may have to do with call routing along the lines of a telephone
switch.

Is there any source of actual info from PacWest?  No status updates on
their web page, nothing on Twitter, their NOC line is dead....

Or a "two routers means we can double our traffic" deployment model.

The NOC in N.Y. that monitors our datacenter equipment in Las Vegas noticed at dropped VPN connection (L3 in Las Vegas), then reconnected without issues about 8-12 minutes later.

Apparently a large cable stretching between Astoria, Oregon and Washington
state (presumably the Megler bridge) was cut ~12:40am Pacific.  Clink crews
started splicing around 5:00am.  They completed the Oregon side of the
splice at 1:00pm and will be complete with the Washington side around
8:00pm local time.  This has affected some, but not all, of my NW Oregon
QMOE circuits.  Clink group ticket #157259.

Level3 has some switch upgrades scheduled for June30th/July1st AM (1-3AM EST) out of 111 8th. That's an Internet POP there for them.

Haven't seen anything today having problems out of 111 8th though, and we've got a ton of circuits supporting Wall St. out of there. No info on Chicago though.

Hope this helps.

There are reports of power problems in NY currently that may have affected you. We lost a site for a brief period of time in Manhattan.

Hi Outages,

We have been receiving reports from users all over the country that they have been failing to connect to our application. For other users everything is working fine. Our application is hosted at Latisys(static.oak01.latisys.net) in Chicago. I myself am experiencing mixed connectivity issue's. I can connect to one of my IP's at Latisys, but not the other. Tracert's indicate that packet is getting to their network.

I'm on the phone now with the Network Architect at my hosting provider, but it looks to me to be a problem in the Latisys datacenter, or with one of their providers. Anyone have any information?

Does your application run on a certain TCP port that we can hit?

Hi Outages,

 

We have been receiving reports from users all over the country that they
have been failing to connect to our application. For other users everything
is working fine. Our application is hosted at
Latisys(static.oak01.latisys.net) in Chicago. I myself am experiencing mixed
connectivity issue's. I can connect to one of my IP's at Latisys, but not
the other. Tracert's indicate that packet is getting to their network.

Does not work for me:

Does your application run on a certain TCP port that we can hit?

Hi Outages,

 

We have been receiving reports from users all over the country that they
have been failing to connect to our application. For other users everything
is working fine. Our application is hosted at
Latisys(static.oak01.latisys.net) in Chicago. I myself am experiencing mixed
connectivity issue's. I can connect to one of my IP's at Latisys, but not
the other. Tracert's indicate that packet is getting to their network.

Does not work for me:

I'm on the phone now with the Network Architect at my hosting provider, but
it looks to me to be a problem in the Latisys datacenter, or with one of
their providers. Anyone have any information?

Shouldn't you open a support ticket with your provider?

This looks like a problem specifically with your service that they provide,
rather than a wider outage..?

I know Feedly just experienced a DDoS attack a couple of days ago, but

Any ideas?

Feedly has been under attack for a while and they aren?t using good DDoS mitigation providers, it?s probably getting hit periodically. ?Also, it seems that their authentication mechanisms are fragile. ?The oAuth seems to break periodically on their end.

I'm hearing whispered reports of AAG being down since
last Friday, but I'm not seeing anything in the current
press at the moment.  If folks have circuits on AAG,
would love a quiet indication if you're seeing link down
on your AAG paths or not.

Thanks!

We were seeing an odd issue reaching a site in Texas via TATA out of 
ORD.  Via JFK and Cogent, all seemed OK.  The odd thing is that the 
packets not getting to the site were protocol specific ?!?! I figured it 
was a firewall issue at the CPE end. Perhaps broken QoS or load 
balancing something or another ?
It started at 06:08 GMT-4 (East coast time)

I?m not sure if you?re referring to their IP network or their cellular service, but they seem to be going on 24+ hours of a billing/activation/provisioning outage on their wireless side.

http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/27/5849620/verizon-wireless-systems-are-offline

There are a few VZW reps in this reddit thread chiming in with more details:

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/298yt9/verizon_wireless_customers_have_been_unable_to/

Customer facing issues include being unable to activate/change service, and if you dial #MIN to check your usage, instead of the automated system you?re being forwarded to a representative who can?t tell you much.

I can?t vouch for it?s authenticity, but I?ve seen this in a few places now:

> Teams continue to work towards full restoration and there is no ETA at this time.
> Agents/Retailers are unable to access some customer accounts, primarily located out of the Midwest and Northeast areas. Users are experiencing errors when attempting to access existing customer accounts. A small number of new activations are also be impacted.
> CORe is also impacted by this issue. Agents/Retailers should NOT call CORe if experiencing this issue.
> This is being tracked under critical ticket CR172528. Next update at 2:30 PM EST or as soon as new information becomes available.

You'll probably want to hit HE's looking glass in the future as well (
http://lg.he.net). I'm not sure which router(s) AT&T peers with, but it
wouldn't be too hard to figure out. Also, I apologize for the lop-sidedness
of their looking glass... When I wrote it while working at HE I didn't
expect the network to grow quite as much; were I still there I'd fix it ;-)
