For several hours now, I have been getting connections refused,
connection timeouts, and the occasional "421 #4.4.5 Too many connections
to this host." for SMTP connections to smtp.secureserver.net and
mailstore1.secureserver.net.

Is anybody else seeing this?  Anybody know what's going on?

Just posted this on mailops.
=================
Since about noon central we started seeing email (hosted by GoDaddy) backed
up for multiple domains across two IP addresses.  Here are the two IPs and
some sample logged items:

216.69.186.201
Open (216.69.186.201) Error 1sec (421 #4.4.5 Too many connections to this
host.)
Open (216.69.186.201) Error 180sec (399 TCP Read failed (Err Code Zero after
180 seconds) 180 sec)

72.167.238.201
Open (72.167.238.201) Error 21sec (399 TCP Read failed (Connection timed out
after 0 seconds) 0 sec)

It peaked for us around 1 pm Central and is now going down slightly.

Our CMTS application vendor reported a layer-2 broadcast issue at one of their colo data centers at about the same time. Might be related. 

I've just gotten email that the issue was resolved. Anyone still experiencing the problem?

The traceroute doesn't mean much in this case as I get the same output for both mysql.com and oracle.com, yet oracle.com is accessible over HTTP.

By CMTS do you mean "Cable Modem Termination System", or is it an
abbreviation for something else?

The GoDaddy issue appears to be resolved because the backlog has been gone
for several hours.

Our CMTS application vendor reported a layer-2 broadcast issue at one of
their colo data centers at about the same time. Might be related. 

I've just gotten email that the issue was resolved. Anyone still
experiencing the problem?

Frank,

Yes, that's what I was referring to. We use 3rd party vendor to manage our
cable modems, and the notices I got from them matched up with the times of
the GoDaddy issues.

23:56 +0000 UTC == 18:56 @ -0500 UTC

I imagine that's been more than enough time for Oracle to figure out
what was wrong + resolve it.

Furthermore, apparently I'm the only one who took the time to look up
the fact that DNS-wise, www.mysql.com is a CNAME with a record TTL of
300 seconds, so it may be possible that DNS-based load-balancing is
involved.  mysql.com's SOA indicates a serial number of 2012090604,
which (if you go purely off of the serial as a timestamp), indicates its
been updated roughly 4 times today (09/06, Pacific Time).

TL;DR -- Oracle would be the only source of truth regarding this outage.

Message-ID: <92EEAACE-0AB8-4070-A276-330B1A67990D@bobman.net>

Looks like FairPoint NNE (serving ME, NH, and VT) is having trouble again with their peering with Cogent. I see significant packet loss between Cogent and FairPoint. This is a repeat of the event on July 3rd.

FairPoint has been notified by a couple of their customers (not sure how they handle these kinds of tickets internally).

We have a site in Auburn ME down for 15+ hours. Fairpoint is reporting it
is due to a fiber cut with no ETR. Not sure if this is related.

Appears to be a cut between Concord & Bangor, ME that's causing
heartburn and  there also appears to be an outage in Amherst, New
Hampshire.

Looks like a problem inside godaddy as I can trace into their network but
the last hop appears to be unreachable

It appears to be more than just their premium DNS service - I am not able to get responses from various ns??.domaincontrol.com nameservers that I have queried as well.  I have not identified a pattern yet though - for example I can get answers from ns43 and ns44.domaincontrol.com over IPv6 but not over IPv4

Just actually replied to a customer, looks like a lot of domaincontrol.com
dns servers are down from here as well.

I am also seeing thing DNS related with godaddy failing. Which in turn 
is causing clients who host with us to have there sites go off-line due 
to the DNS issues.

I am still digging here. But there whois server isn't getting resolved. 
I was able to hit the IP directly by getting it from Google's resolver. 
But then after that I tried to dig directly to some of the DNS server 
specifically NS19.DOMAINCONTROL.COM  ( 216.69.185.10 )

And get no reply on the requested domain.

Sincerely

Mark

For the last 15 minutes we've seen 12 customer domains using GoDaddy
authoritative DNS servers go dark.  One came back.  Nothing on the GoDaddy
Twitter feed other than a mention of "problems with their site" about 30
minutes ago.  Anyone else seeing this?

Its more than just Premium DNS.  We're seeing a slew of customer domains
going dark, all of which are hosted on any number of
nsxx.domaincontrol.comauthoritative servers.

Yes. I'm seeing the same thing. No response from either PDNS01 nor PDNS02.

FWIW, of all the DNS providers I've used in the last 20 years, I've been happiest with www.EasyDNS.com and Amazon AWS Route53.

Message-ID: <00b801cd8f8b$db931cd0$92b95670$@mediaG.com>

So, in amidst all this craziness with GoDaddy today, I also noticed that
Wide Open West, at least in parts of Michigan, is not responsive. A couple
of our clients' connections went down at the same time, and I can't get
through to WOW's 888 number. Can anyone else replicate/reproduce these
issues?

Looks like many networks are not rfc2182 compliant.  If you suffered an outage, you should read this.

I'm guessing someone's e-mail was delayed a year late about their
stance on SOPA...just kidding :)

On a serious note, *if* this attack was towards their DNS
infrastructure wondering if there was simultaneous outage of several
anycast instances?

Just curious.

Funny--I *just* had that conversation with a GoDaddy customer this
morning and they dismissed it.
Once their VoIP server is reachable again, I'll have to give them a call... ;)

Yes and no... I suspect a lot of individuals relying on GoDaddy (and other large providers) for DNS hosting *assume* that a large, established provider is going to engineer a highly available solution, and that GoDaddy has taken the appropriate steps to ensure diversity of their DNS hosts.

Of course, we all know that's not true... there is no such thing as "too big to fail". A highly effective DDOS attack can bring large providers to their knees. Personally, I typically replicate DNS for domains I deal with across multiple providers to avoid collateral damage when an upstream DNS provider goes dark (i.e. secondaries across diverse providers). YMMV.

I won't name and shame, but being in the VoIP industry let's just say it's been a fun afternoon since finding out my main upstream provider has all their DNS on GoDaddy.  They will be hearing from me as soon as I can resolve their mail server again.

"that" link?

Sure, where "that" == "every non-revenue producing".

It's either referring to a BGP/OSPF/IS-IS (insert dynamic routing
protocol here) bug or a line of corporate-speak BS that sounds technical
enough to where most people aren't going to ask for details.

My WAGs would be bridge loop or internal/external routing fubar, in that 
order.  The bridge loop looks kind of DDoSish at first, depending on where 
you're looking, because all the traffic looks normal enough, except the 
quantity, and it very quickly gets to the point where interfaces are 100% 
full and CLIs become unusably lagged.

It's the easy answer to avoid admitting they where DDOS, when you can't explain something or you don't want to admit something blame it on "corruption"

The outages start and stop at the time predicted by the hacker who "admit" it.. how could that happen.. coincidence ?

Frankly, "we were ddos'd" is a much better sell than "we screwed up our internal systems horribly because we're idiots.". Surprised they went this direction.

It does make sense from UK traffic perspective, some AS's worked for queries, some AS's did not get a connection at all.

Curious? why did you wonder if they have Brocade routing gear? Wondering what prompted you to ask about that particular brand? Should I be worried about something?

If you run any TCAM based system and take full BGP tables on them, then, yes, you:
A: should be worries and / or 
B: should have started trimming tables to fit in CAM and / or 
C: should have started fiddling with the CAM sizing / layout and / or
D: be chatting with your vendor and checking the CAM size on your line cards.

There is no evidence yet that it was CAM exhaustion vs any of a whole bunch of other failures, but hey, now at least you know to start looking :-P

Clearly you have never run a network.  (Although there are ways GoDaddy could have ensured no single ASN could take out their service, but that is another matter.)

Also, I know of no backbone provider who saw large flows towards the affected name servers.  While there is clear selection bias here, I am reasonable confident that I would have seen or heard of a large scale attack. 

So believe as you please.  I am going to take GoDaddy at their word.  And I'm going to give them credit for owning up to the mistake, in public.

I'm not surprised Go-Daddy went in the direction of "internal network events that corrupted router data tables". It is definitely the lesser of the two evils. To come out and admit they were hacked or experienced a DDOS would make Customers feel their information on Go-Daddy servers was potentially compromised. Hence the CEO's statement, " At no time was any customer data at risk or were any of our systems compromised."

Unless there's a government investigation, which is doubtful, none of us will really ever know what truly happened.

Frankly, "we were ddos'd" is a much better sell than "we screwed up our internal systems horribly because we're idiots.". Surprised they went this direction.

Your right! perhaps DDOS does not mean any data have been compromise, it simply mean someone decide to piss you off.., and personally I prefer honesty, or more detail answer then "corrupted data" which is too easy.. let see what they going to say on that one.. 

http://pastebin.com/WMb4Qg7H

I guess it's a internal leak.. I'm not good enough in programation to say if this is fake or real or publicly available, clearly there missing stuff.. like the DB :) perhaps for me it appear a bit more serious and making sense then the godaddy story about yesterday failure.

What a bunch of FUD. Everything is pointing to the fact that it was
probably exactly what GoDaddy says it was, and a random bunch of
python scripts that are full of Chinese don't point things in any
other direction.

More specifically: there was ICMP packet loss on the DNS servers, and
it was partial, at about 90%-95%. This suggests saturated ports. Like
Patrick has said, there are no flows anywhere that suggest it was a
volumetric DDoS attack on their servers. This means it was either some
sophisticated zero-day layer 7 attack on DNS servers (doesn't sound
very likely to me... why would GoDaddy be the target of something like
that?), or there was just an internal technical issue.


There will always be people who wildly speculate and then grasp onto
those theories regardless of any evidence that suggests otherwise, but
I hope that on a list of network professionals we can put that sort of
speculation to rest.

Interoute are having a major issue in London - we're seeing it affect 
several circuits from them.

I believe they have multiple master tickets open (one for each team), 
but one is 1-500518083.

An engineer should have arrived on site approximately an hour ago.
Their call centre is *very* busy - been in a queue for about 25 minutes 
now trying to get an update.

Amen to that. Beyond, let's wait until further information comes out
instead of jumping on finger pointing trying to "force" a vendor to
defend against  unsubstantiated claims about a handful of files from
2010 and '302' responses on some SQLi attempts.

Also, perhaps a thread can be posted to 'outages-discussion' for
followup on whether or not you believe GoDaddy's claims, and to
discuss some credible information that might exist to the contrary,
rather than in 'outages' proper.

As stated this was not a DDoS or a hack.  The statements released by GoDaddy were
100% true.  I am a network engineer and a part of your community so I wouldn't risk
deceiving the group.  It was a really bad day for us as we take great pride in our
network and the internet as a whole.

Jason,

Thank you for being upfront and open.  That goes a LONG way on the credibility 
path for many of us.

I'm afraid I must agree with Darius here, although I would not have put it exactly like that.

First, I do not know any network who would rather admit they made an error and denied service to customers than say they were being attacked by someone else.  There is no network on the planet which is immune to DoS.  (Well, almost no network <wink-wink>. =)

I'm confused why anyone would think that "DDoS" == "customer data breech".  I'm even more confused why anyone would be worried about someone getting access to records which are intentionally published as publicly and as widely as possible.

There is no evidence of a DDoS, there is multiple admissions of internal error, and other anecdotal evidence points at same.

Absent other data, I think we should put this thread to rest and wait for GoDaddy to have time to put together a proper RFO.  (And please no comments about the time they are taking.  If you have ever had a major outage and needed to write up an official RFO, you would understand it is not a 12 hour process.)

Amen to that. Beyond, let's wait until further information comes out
instead of jumping on finger pointing trying to "force" a vendor to
defend against unsubstantiated claims about a handful of files from
2010 and '302' responses on some SQLi attempts.

Also, perhaps a thread can be posted to 'outages-discussion' for
followup on whether or not you believe GoDaddy's claims, and to
discuss some credible information that might exist to the contrary,
rather than in 'outages' proper.

Please join the discussion list and <ahem> discuss it there.

Many of us are here to learn of service-impacting or customer-impacting
events that result in action immediately.  The knowledge of this event
helped us close several tickets yesterday.  I simply don't care one bit why
it happened, it doesn't affect our company or our customers in any way.
 The pollution on this EVENTS list makes it worth a lot less, and
discourages people being on it.

Shouldn't this have gone to Outages-discussion a long time ago?

Amen to that. Beyond, let's wait until further information comes out
instead of jumping on finger pointing trying to "force" a vendor to
defend against unsubstantiated claims about a handful of files from
2010 and '302' responses on some SQLi attempts.

Also, perhaps a thread can be posted to 'outages-discussion' for
followup on whether or not you believe GoDaddy's claims, and to
discuss some credible information that might exist to the contrary,
rather than in 'outages' proper.

Official RFOs, yes: relevant;  official word on the disposition of the
outage, assurance that it's over.   It is useful to know if an outage
is over and not likely to recur -- ex an attack is more likely to
recur than an error that was repaired.

"I saw it down, but it seems back up [or partially back up]",  maybe: relevant

"Official word is its back up and it's not expected to break again for
now",   yes: relevant

What if 'corruption' in this case meant 'tampering'?  Is it possible
that their routing tables were corrupted either by injection or
someone compromising a router and reconfiguring it?

It's been a few years since I last heard about route injection (at
DefCon, wasn't it?) so I don't know whether or not it's widely
possible, or at least plausible in the case of GoDaddy.

I don't think this is the case. I've done my own (rudimentary)
analysis, and their routers were unaffected as far as the BGP DFZ
is concerned (check http://bgplay.routeviews.org or http://bgp.potaroo.net
against their route announcements and you won't see any unusual
activity). Normally, NANOG tends to be quick on routing issues if
they affect the Internet, but everyone seemed to be more focused
on the DNS issues at the time. Some actually claiming connectivity
(albeit intermittent) by IP.

Going from what they've said, chatter on the Internet (and on this
list), and the conjectures this is what I've concluded:

If it were a BGP issue, it would have to be an incredibly nasty iBGP problem. The nature of the problem would've had to shown intermittent connectivity as there are posted traceroutes (under this subject thread) during the outage showing reachability to GoDaddy. Having said that, to take 5-12 hours to recover doesn't really sound accurate at all, even if it was a misconfiguration. Diagnostics and active monitoring software which undoubtedly they have in place can usually pinpoint the problem. But supposing they don't have their act together at all, it's still a more convenient excuse than the alternatives.

If it was a security breach, this will surmount to more negative publicity, media outlets spreading information, and basically scaring off their customer base. They also participate in the browser CA oligarchy, so I imagine people would think twice before purchasing an SSL certificate from GoDaddy.

If it was a DoS/DDoS attack, they're basically admitting their capacity and equipment is inadequate. Competitors will target their customer base claiming they're DDoS resilient (which for the most part is BS marketing), and they will probably lose a hearty chunk of customers.

Lastly, GoDaddy may have no understanding or comprehension of the events that occured during the outage, outside of what we already know. This could be plausible assuming they weren't retaining logs of all their network devices, or did not have enough information (such as storing netflow data during a DoS/DDoS).

I'm not going to argue that spreading disinformation is ethical or unethical given the circumstances, but I assume it would be the safest position for the company. Also given that two of their employees, in this list, are quick to promise they wouldn't spread disinformation, it just makes everything seem more suspicious. Also, every announcement is quick to denounce that the outage is due to a security breach or DoS/DDoS attack. This just seems to be a tactic to save face, and to avoid blowback from media outlets that could pick it up, sensationalize it, and result in more negative press.

At least by claiming it was their fault either intentionally or unintentionally, they can at least regain customer confidence and goodwill, dish out a bunch of service credit, and everyone can forget about it. But, from all the discussions so far, and what they've actually said, nothing adds up. In any case, the best bet is to wait for more information.

Is anyone seeing any issues to 4.2.2.2?

At 3:35 EST I starting seeing packet loss (icmp ping) to it -  http://imgur.com/ITGL1

I noticed at the same time we had a route change with RR (Time Warner Cable) in Chicago.

Nope, my local one seems solid. These are anycasted, so I'm hitting
the one in San Jose, California.

Maybe try and MTR or some other hop-by-hop analysis and see if it's a
bad path to 4.2.2.2 or some other link in-between.

Yup, looks lossy and not normal.

I can reproduce it over here as well. Maybe Level 3 is finally getting sick
of people using it for ping testing after all these years? :)

4.2.2.2 is an anycast address, so any answer to this will likely depend on
exactly where you are, and which 4.2.2.2 you are hitting...

FYI - Dug little deeper, maybe coincidence but right about the same

I have graphs that shows spike in DNS response time off PUCK :)

4.2.2.x are *authoritatively* multicast; I have that from someone who
is involved in running recursive DNS for whatever the hell they're calling
themselves this year.  :-)

In other news: not all 6 of those servers will always respond to ping traffic
even if they're resolving; it's random; presumably they don't want anyone
to get too settled into using them as a ping beacon to watching the weather
on the 'net.  Understandably.

Just a reminder to all:

intermediate hops on a traceroute may show high packet drops *without that
router actually dropping any real traffic packets*.  Many routers are 
required by their design to force ICMP traffic up into the CPU, where actual
packets may remain down on the much more efficient cross-linecard-path, which
means that if the router gets too busy doing "Real work", the ICMP will be 
the first thing to go.

Evidence of this is usually a large degree of packet loss which starts and
ends with one hop in your trace; if *everything past a certain point* seems
to be dropping roughly the same percentage of traffic, *that* is probably
the outbound link from the router.

More importantly, unless something has changed in the past year or so Level
3 has always stated that the 4.2.2.X (yes there are others like .1 - .6) DNS
severs are NOT production level systems and they will not provide any
support for them.  A good piece of evidence to this is that they don't
charge for their use and Level 3 doesn't give much of anything away for
free.  If this is wrong and someone from Level3 wants to speak to it, I'd be
happy to stand corrected.

Sometimes a forum like NANOG is an appropriate place to mention that there
is a possible issue (you can find this in the achieves), but I'm pretty sure
that either way this would not qualify as an "outage".

If you are using 4.2.2.X for DNS resolution for anything in production in
any way other than as a last resort, I feel sorry for your customers.  We
all like to use it for testing because it's easy to remember and generally
reliable, but I always do so with caution.

Bingo. Traceroute is not a true indicator of packet loss; ping on the other hand would be so long as the endpoint or intermediate endpoints aren't interfering with the flow and don't icmp rate limit.

In any case, I would like to point an excellent resource for interpreting
traceroute results from NANOG47:

My understanding is that they're not supported *for anyone who isn't a 
direct customer of GTE/BBN/L3*; they *are* the customer resolver servers for
their direct end-user customer base.  But that's not evidence, just my 
understanding.

Is anyone seeing any issues to 4.2.2.2?

At 3:35 EST I starting seeing packet loss (icmp ping) to it -  http://imgur.com/ITGL1

I noticed at the same time we had a route change with RR (Time Warner Cable) in Chicago.

Message-ID: <596B74B410EE6B4CA8A30C3AF1A155EA09EDA659@RWC-MBX1.corp.seven.com>

Anyone else seeing this?  Packet loss is so high the web page won't even load.  Other destinations seem to be just fine.  Looks like Uverse reaches Twitter via Level3 who apparently peers with Twitter at what looks like 11 Great Oaks.  Problem was getting progressively worse all morning until about an hour ago.  Not sure if the problem is with Uverse or Level3 in San Jose.

The problem is with AT&T's backbone.

And my reason for posting is that if is a Level3 peering issue with Twitter, the problem may be more widespread than just Uverse customers in the SF Bay Area.  Other destinations reached via Level3 from Uverse seem to be ok.

A few weeks back they changed their web server from (I believe) Sun Webserver over to IIS.

Rumor has it from notices they've posted that a new site is forthcoming; guess we'll find out?

I can't even resolve www.chase.com - looks like the DNS servers for
chase.com are all located in 159.53.0.0/16 (which belongs to JP Morgan
Chase)

 

    ns1.jpmorganchase.com 159.53.46.53

    ns2.jpmorganchase.com 159.53.78.53

    ns05.jpmorganchase.com 159.53.110.152

    ns06.jpmorganchase.com 159.53.110.153

 

Hint: don't put all your DNS servers in your AS or infrastructure.

Working for me (SF Bay, Comcast).  DNS resolves and page loads.

www.chase.com is a CNAME for wwwbcchase.gslb.bankone.com.

and are working to restore full connectivity.

Still down (http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.chase.com =>
It's not just you! http://www.chase.com looks down from here).

But this is no surprise, so I am really not sure why this is a network

in a row, every few months.

I was able to access it earlier today, so apparently it's back down rather
than still broken.

Any other operator seeing a massive AT&T metro-ethernet outage in the Atlanta territory?

Appears to have started at roughly 11:50AM with partial recovery at 12:15PM and back out of service at 12:16:15PM.

We are also being informed that this has affected some national broadcast video traffic (IP) transport as well.

Qwest has a recording on their 800 number saying there is an outage in
Atlanta. Maybe something larger going on in ATL.

Just heard that a core Cisco 7600 router failed causing the outage.

There is.  Parts of AT&T's Metro Ethernet is down in Atlanta.  Likely Qwest uses them for something.

What happened to redundancy, *especially* if this was a "core router"?

We are seeing this in Gainesville, GA.

It is impacting Windstream (formerly Paetec) feed as well, they're probably subbing from ATTs line.

That's just the way AT&T does opt-e-man stuff: two strands of fiber from
every switch in the field directly back to some 7600 in the CO. It's
"core" to all the customers hanging off it, but probably no further than
that.

Every AT&T rep I've ever dealt with on their Metro E offering says that AT&T
does not guarantee any kind of redundancy in their Metro E network.  That's
probably there to protect their more expensive offerings like SONET, etc.

I think it goes further than that. I have customers as far south as
Newnan and as far north as Alpharetta down, all coming out of
different CO/wirecenters.

Then it could be the top router that takes the all uplinks from the
aggregation ones that ties them all together that failed. The last time
I inquired how opt-e-man was laid out it's pretty basic. It's the cheap
no frills no redundancy Ethernet offering. Otherwise you have to pay for
SONET.

Update from ATT with more details:

The issue has been isolated to a LAG bundle between two 7609 routers
in Atlanta and ATS is isolating the offending VLAN so issue can be
mitigated. Network teams have identified the traffic is impacting
ATLNGACS4CW. The source of the traffic has been traced back to
ATLNGAPP4AW. Network teams are attempting to back trace the source of
the traffic on ATLNGAPP4AW to either another router or an access
circuit on this device. Troubleshooting through the network continues
to locate the root source of the VLAN loop. This is a process of
removing LAG bundles and core trunks from service until the CPU and
traffic normalize. The process is underway with ATS and the Cisco is
being engaged for additional support.  There is no ETTR at this time.

All our circuits are back up now. Anybody else getting good news right
about now? Reportedly this took out 1000+ MetroE circuits. Bad day to
be a net eng at AT&T...

Our NOC is reporting that all of our metro-ethernet circuits were restored at 3:40:34PM (Eastern). 

Started with slight packet-loss on return to service and a little bit of latency as I would probably expect based upon the methodology in which AT&T is utilizing to troubleshoot/resolve the issue.

AT&T has not confirmed continuity as of yet so i'm assuming they are still isolating the issue even though traffic is passing.

Any other operator seeing a massive AT&T metro-ethernet outage in the
Atlanta territory? 

 

Appears to have started at roughly 11:50AM with partial recovery at 12:15PM
and back out of service at 12:16:15PM.

 

We are also being informed that this has affected some national broadcast
video traffic (IP) transport as well.

There is an ongoing discussion in the citizens weather observer community that ftp might be being blocked by Comcast? Can anyone confirm this is really the case? Allegedly  started at 6:30am today.  Sorry I cannot provide technical examples. I do not have Comcast at my current location.

Not Comcast cable in Monroeville, PA.  Comcast business, perhaps?

interesting. I have a comcast business line in the office in Connecticut
but only use it for the guest wifi, so the only way I can quickly test
it is on my phone - and indeed I can't FTP. I don't have anything
blocking those ports as it's just a "wild west" guest wifi.

I'm on Comcast residential right now, and I can get to external FTP
services just fine. Do you have some specifics I could try?

Are you talking about outbound FTP (e.g. client on Comcast trying to FTP
to a server on the Internet), or are you talking about inbound FTP (e.g.
client on the Internet trying to FTP to a server hosted on a Comcast
residential connection)?  The direction matters.

1. Comcast does not filter outbound FTP requests (Comcast->Internet)

2. Comcast does not usually filter inbound FTP requests
(Internet->Comcast), however if the customer is a residential customer
this is not permitted per TOS).  If the customer is commercial/business
then no filtering is done.

In the case of a residential customer hosting a server, if Comcast finds
this, they usually deploy filtering at the cable modem level (by pushing
out an updated cable modem config to the customer which is picked up via
TFTP + rebooting the modem remotely).

There is no way around this aside from talking to Comcast on the phone
or moving the server to another port (which is not advisable on
residential connections as Comcast would probably terminate service in
this situation).

I can confirm on residential connections that *normally* Comcast does
permit inbound FTP traffic reaching the customer.  Below is from tcpdump
on my router (on Comcast), where the client is trying to connect to my
Comcast IP on TCP port 21.  As you can see, the SYN does arrive:

09:05:49.737352 IP 209.126.140.25.57088 > 67.180.84.87.21: Flags [S], seq 31607697, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 6,sackOK,TS val 3722921725 ecr 0], length 0

FTP clients working fine via IPv4 from Comcast residential in both Mountain View, CA and Salt Lake City, UT. Only passive mode tested. 

Testing from off-net to Comcast IPv4 port 21 in SLC shows the SYN made it, and RST was generated by my host. 

Perhaps if there is a block on servers, it's selective (heavy user, etc). They're not blocking me.

There is an ongoing discussion in the citizens weather observer community that ftp might be being blocked by Comcast? Can anyone confirm this is really the case? Allegedly  started at 6:30am today.  Sorry I cannot provide technical examples. I do not have Comcast at my current location.

I can honestly say that all the ports blocked on that list have a
legitimate reason. Kudos to Comcast for actually caring.

I made a purchase less than an hour ago (car parts) and then went across
the street to Walmart and found my credit card wasn't working - tried it
twice.  I used another card and it worked.  The successful purchase is
listed on their website - capitalone.com

It seems their phones are down/busy - 804.934.2001 or 800.955.7070 from my
landline, Verizon cell and Google Voice.

Never seen anything like this before.  Does anyone have any other

Tracing through the twitter comments, it appears at least some of the

Calls are completing for me now.  The CSR said my card didn't work because
the merchant provider wasn't working (MC) and that they're using a
different one for Discover.

No issues seen here in Denver via IPv4 (Cogent) or IPv6 (L3). Also looks 
fine via CenturyLink in Denver on both IPv4 and IPv6.

No issues seen here in Denver via IPv4 (Cogent) or IPv6 (L3). Also looks fine via CenturyLink in Denver on both IPv4 and IPv6.

Yes, we are a customer of XO and there is intermittent connectivity.  Possibly a peering issue similar to one that they had back at the first of the year. Notified XO at 955 am MST and there were barely aware of the issue.

Seeing same from LAX & ATL on Level3, fine from CentLink. Started at 11:33 ET. Was unable to reach several sites at that time, however most have resolved. Also saw issues with L3 on net in Denver. Level3 stated there is an issue in Miami... FWIW.

XO has confirmed with me that they are having a major issue which is also effecting Level 3 at this time.

Turning down 2828 has resolved our problems here.

While on-hold with XO, a robotic voice broke in and stated that they
have identified and corrected the problem affecting connectivity across
their network and to please try again.

Still seeing some issues, but we are reaching out to customers to see if
connectivity is restored.

No further information from XO.

They have updated twitter with a confirmation: twitter.com/XOCare
"There is currently an outage related to a peering problem with Level 3
communications.  At this time we do not have an ETR"

I'm currently seeing traffic pass again between L3 and XO in NY.

https://www.onlinebanking.pnc.com/ does not seem to be effected (or at least does not have an error page up).

Looks like they are blocking ICMP at their edge, my trace ends up at  the same path as yours.

Since approx. 4am CT, we've been seeing 15-30% dropped packets for traffic going from our Chicago Level3 connection to Amazon's EAST-1 data center.  Our San Francisco office (also using Level3) isn't experiencing a problem.  I've re-routed this traffic to our backup Internet connection (Airlogic) for now, and that traffic is getting through just fine.  Anyone else seeing this problem?  Ticket already opened with Level3, waiting to hear back.  Thank you.

Here's the route my traffic is taking (time outs at the bottom are normal, ICMP gets blocked from that point on).

George,

For the future: you need to provide traceroutes from both directions.
Most routing these days is asymmetric.  Heavily covered here:

http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog47/presentations/Sunday/RAS_Traceroute_N47_Sun.pdf

But now that you've "re-routed traffic" (I assume you simply denounced
and de-peered with your AS3356 peering point?  Or did you physically
down an interface?), the reverse-path traceroute (from 75.101.163.221 to
wherever you did the original TCP ping from) won't necessarily be the
same as when you were being impacted.

TL;DR -- always provide traceroutes from both directions, and always
perform this *before* making any routing/peering changes.

We've got a ticket open with Level3 that appears to be the same issue that
we've narrowed down with test cases to an issue in Level3's network in
Washington.  We suspect a problem with an individual link in a bundle that's
blackholing traffic.  Level3's escalated our ticket to the team that handles
those things, but we haven't heard anything back yet.

Dunno if this helps or muddies the water.

I'm seeing an average of 122ms ("http response time") across all 14
networks (comcast, att, google, verizon, cox, qwest, charter, opendns,
cablevision, bellsouth, twc, level3) etc) for Amazon EC2 US EAST 1A.

Narrowing down to LEVEL3, I'm seeing an average of 180ms for http
response time. However http connect time seems to be around 400ms
compared to att, cox, verizon and qwest which is about 300ms.

Doesn't prove anything but thought I bring it up for what I see based
off external monitor. Sorry no raw data.

/virendra

Jeremy, 

Thank you for the traceroute link.  It was very informative.  To answer your re-route question, I manually entered some routes on my firewall to redirect traffic to my backup ISP's line.

That said, our service seems to be back to normal.  While I haven't gotten an update on the trouble ticket I have opened with my ISP, another person on this mailing list had reported that his (possibly related) issue had been resolved (a Level3 network issue in Washington).  So I tested again, and now I'm up and running.

Thanks to everyone for their input.

Access to www.amazon.com was coming back with:
Http/1.1 Service Unavailable

It seems to be back up now.
