Thousands in Minnesota Without Phone Service, Includes 911 Access

 A fiber optic outage in Osseo shortly after noon Sunday quickly spread in
 the north and west metro, causing about 98,000 customers to lose some or
 all of their phone service.
 There were reports out of Carver and Hennepin counties that 911 service was
 down for some customers, but Colleen Floyd, a spokeswoman for telephone
 service provider Embarq, said that is still being investigated.
 About 70,000 Embarq customers did not have a dial tone at all and an
 additional 28,000 could not make or receive long-distance calls, Floyd
 said. Embarq is a former division of Sprint.

 Looks like there's some problem with Cingular/AT&T Wireless in the
 NY/NJ metro area.  Calls outside of the network fail, sometimes with a
 message from the MSO sometimes with a SIT tone on the handset.  Anyone
 else seeing any problems? I've been having them from at least 8:30
 eastern.

 There is an issue with the AT&T/Cingular voice network in the
 NYC/Northern NJ area, this is being tracked under ticket
 #TT00005269557 (Thanks Jonathan!), there is however no ETR.

 Hey everyone,
 Seems to be a major issues with Broadwing/Level3.  Our BGP session went kaput
 about fifteen minutes ago.  Traceroutes from Sprint and AT&T make it
 one or two hops into their network.  NOC line is busy... has anyone heard
 any info?

 We lost a broadwing DS3 in SF.
 Back now, mostly.
 Ditto here, our OC12 BGP session to Bwing/L3 died along the same
 timeline...
 Thank goodness for proper design and backup capacity !

 Same here.  Number of prefixes from Broadwing in Cleveland Ohio went to
 ~2200 and latency to next hop ICMP RTT ~300ms.  We also have a lot of
 Broadwing DIA resale lines in Chicago area that we can not get to while
 other Broadwing circuits elsewhere are reachable.  BW/L3 NOC lines are
 jammed but did get through.  Got the usual "We know something is wrong but
 not exactly what." 
 Looks like a major routing blowup somewhere.

 It was likely an automated task that removed the config. Admittedly, there
 should be better safeguards, but I'd be surprised if it was a conscious
 action on someone's part.

 Generator),It is very important that the EPG configurations are
 functioning during a power event as they are then the main (only) source
 of power to the critical load. In all the configurations, UPS systems
 are installed to deal with the start up times of the systems. The UPS
 systems are designed to be able to maintain power for at least two hours
 in case of EPG failure.
 Customer Impact: No impact is expected to customer equipment housed at
 the facility.
 Description of Classification:

 high potential of impacting the service of Level 3 customers external or
 internal, even if no impact is expected.  These changes are often more
 complex in nature and thus incur more risk to the environment.
