Washington Charter?
###############################################################
 Were seeing a pretty major outtage here in Central Washington:
 12    90 ms    91 ms    94 ms  gx-x.cr01.mdfd.or.charter.com [68.116.79.10]
 13     *        *        *     Request timed out.
 This is affecting their cable customers and a few ISPs in town that use
 them for backbone services. Supposedly they have a router out, and no ETA
 on fixing it.
 Any new info anywhere?
 Thanks,
 Kyle Duren

 One of our connections is a fiber link with Charter that's backhaul is a
 different interface on the same core router in Medford, OR.
 We were advised of maintenance lasting from 00:00 to 06:00 PDT on both
 April 2nd and 3rd.  However, as of about 09:00 this morning, our
 interface was still not passing traffic.  It appears to be working again
 as of right now (12:00).

 Bad form replying to my own messages, I know... but it turns out we have
 had intermittent issues periodically with this link throughout the day
 since my last message.  Additionally, our BGP session with Charter has
 been dead since last night's maintenance, so we're only able to utilize
 them for outbound traffic (by stuffing a static route in for them).
 Their NOC is now reporting this as a "fiber cut" with no ETR.
 Interesting...

 Apparently there's an outage affecting both Enterprise (BES) and
 Internet users data service.  There is no ETR (it's been going on
 since approx 8 ET), I'm not sure if it affects all carriers, but it is
 confirmed on Cingular.

 I can confirm it with Nextel/Sprint. I'm seeing reports of T-Mobile as well and Cingular as you've already mentioned.
 Local news is reporting that they expect this issue to go into tomorrow.

 That's probably why - since they're homed to the US and thus connect to
 the North American servers. I bet if the Blackberry was homed to a UK
 carrier - it would be fine since it would route through RIM's UK
 servers.

 Yes - that's exactly my point - any Blackberries from T-Mobile UK or
 anywhere else are configured to go to the local Blackberry server in
 that area/country.
 So, the Cingular Blackberries, being originally from North America -
 would connect to the North American servers. A T-Mobile UK Blackberry
 would more than likely connect to a server in the UK or at least in
 Europe.

 I'm sure you heard that cogent is having peering issues.
 I'm still waiting for cogent's network status page to be updated.
 Until then, if anyone has any further insight into this issue, please

Charter.net NW
###############################################################
 Just as a heads up, Charter NW (in Washington, Oregon, and Northern
 California) is experiencing a pretty major IP outage.
 We noticed our latency for traffic over one of their business fiber
 links started spiking at around 06:30 PDT today; I just (as of 11:15
 PDT) brought the interface back up without advertising our networks via
 BGP, and still am seeing intermittent issues.  I confirmed the issue
 with a couple of other contacts utilizing Charter for connectivity in
 the affected area.
 Their NOC has a message stating that the outage is still ongoing, with
 no ETR.

Asia-U.S. Undersea Cable Avoids Earthquakes

 -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
 Hash: SHA1
 ?Asian phone companies unveiled plans on Friday to build a $500 million
 undersea cable between Southeast Asia and the United States to speed
 connections in the region and avoid earthquake zones,? according to
 Yahoo! News. The new fiber-optic cable that is being planned due to the
 fact that existing cables are nearing their full capacity is to be
 routed away from earthquake-prone locations in order to avoid
 international telecommunications problems like those that we saw at the
 end of last year."
