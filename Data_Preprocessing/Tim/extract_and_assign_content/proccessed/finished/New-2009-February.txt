 I'm not sure what problems exist but I'm in downtown Austin and I appear
 to have full 3G capabilities. I can web, sms, call, and I'm not on a
 wireless network. :)

Embarq issues in the SE?

 I'm getting reports from some of our customers in the opposite corner of 
 the country losing connectivity. All seems to be (pardon the pun) connected 
 to Embarq (ex Sprint?)
 Anyone have a clue what might be going on?

Charleston SC DSL Outage?
###############################################################
 Hi,
 As Murphy would have it, I am out of town and it appears that all 3 of
 my DSL connections in the Charleston, SC area are out. My ISP said
 that AT&T admits to a major DSL outage in coastal SC, and that it will
 be tomorrow morning before it is fixed.
 I had one line fail about 14:00 UTC, and the other two fail about 19:00 UTC.
 Anyone know what is going on and why it is taking them the better part
 of a day to get everything back on-line?
 Needless to say, I am having to send this from my gmail account,
 rather than my normal company account.
 Any info appreciated.

 Hacker Attacks on Time Warner Cable's Servers
 During the past week, hackers have launched a series of attacks on Time
 Warner Cable's servers.  Time Warner Cable is working with law enforcement
 agencies to resolve these crimes.
 As a result of these attacks, you may have experienced a temporary "outage"
 when attempting to surf the Web, including an intermittent "page cannot be
 displayed" error message. The outages did not result in services being 100%
 unavailable; and were limited to sporadic timeouts which appeared to be
 random events.  Some users may have experienced a total disconnect, however.
 These types of attacks are not uncommon, especially for a network as large
 as ours. We suspect that the attackers are using "zombie computers," or
 hijacking unsuspecting subscribers' machines to perpetrate the attack
 without its owner's knowledge.
 All of us at TWC take these attacks extremely seriously. As previously
 mentioned, we are working with the appropriate law enforcement agencies that
 specialize in investigating these types of crimes. We will pursue
 prosecution of all perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law. We
 apologize for the inconvenience that these attacks may have caused and
 encourage you to report any suspicious activity. Please Contact Us for
 instructions on how to report security abuse.
