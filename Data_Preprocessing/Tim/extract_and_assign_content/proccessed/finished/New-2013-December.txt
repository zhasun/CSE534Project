  =============
 For a short period this afternoon (EST, western CT), my TiVo box
 could not access my account on the TiVo service.  I thought
 little of it, as short-term (3 to 6 hour) outages are a frequent
 occurrence (apprx. weekly or every other week) with the TiVo
 service.

Charter Outage??
###############################################################
 I'm seeing more than 50% of our connections with charter offline and
 almost 100% in the eastern half of the US. Have been hold waiting for
 a rep for over 40 minutes thus far. This is both Fiber and Cable
 connections.
 Anyone else seeing this or have any details? I know some of the areas
 could be storm related but they all dropped at the same time and in
 areas on both sides of the storm

 We're in Verona WI and we received a boatload of helpdesk tickets from our tech services staff members about connectivity problems getting to our customer sites, but zero tickets about any voice problems (Charter is our first-choice outgoing for long distance, which we do a ton of).  I'm thinking that we would've seen tickets about voice problems too if there were any.
 As soon as we shutdown our Charter BGP sessions, connectivity to our customer sites was restored.

 Not sure if this helps or hinders the issue(s) presented:
 One of our Charter connections (DOCSIS) never lost IP transit between
 Cleveland, TN and Atlanta, Ga.
 Circuit (VC) Originates on Charter IP Transit/Transport and arrives via
 IP-Transit (non-private-peering) in Atlanta.
 Happy to provide more information, if it's of use to someone while
 investigating what appears to be a national outage/issue.

 Correction... Teammate shut down our BGP sessions after calling charter and being told they had "a global BGP issue" and they were manually adding BGP routes to their equipment (not sure what that means).
 Our traffic and connectivity graphs indicate the problem started around 2am central. My teammate says his home charter internet service was out when he woke up this morning too.

 We went down hard for a while on our Charter connections (St. Louis area). Some things are coming back but I believe there are still a lot of issues.

 I can confirm both the coax and fiber outages in Wausau,Wisconsin. Not
 being with an ISP or having the fancy lookup tools some of you guys have,
 our fiber appears to be back up.  We've had clients all over the state
 rolling up/down beginning early this morning.
 Is there any word if this is affecting voice services as well?
 Thanks,
 Anthony Hook

 In the future, a source IP, destination IP (Google has more than one DNS
 server), and traceroute would be useful.

 Those are valid Google IPs, so this is likely working as intended and you
 were just temporarily being load-balanced to a different datacenter.  If
 you're still concerned, please send me more detail off-list.

Hurricane Electric - Atlanta, Georgia - Outage (ATLNGAMA)
###############################################################
 Not sure if this issue has been corrected and/or fully resolved, however,
 we noted a massive outage with Hurricane Electric starting at 4PM Eastern.
 Appears as though some BGP connections have re-established themselves for
 about 25 minutes or so, however we have had a couple of other HE BGP
 facilities bounce since. Also noted some odd routing that had taken place
 on the exchange at exactly the same time.

 We have four private T1's that have been down for coming up on 24 hours now.
 AT&T tells us there is a large fiber cut and that over 400 fibers are in

 The initial ETTR was around 10:00 AM ET, but that came and went. The new
 ETTR is 4:00 PM ET.

 Zaid:
 Thanks.  I tried traceroutes points before and after the Level3 routers and
 am not seeing that packet loss.  Is it possible the issue is only between
 your network and Level3?  But I also checked from several Calfornia
 locations on Level3's lookingglass to 199.101.162.229 and saw no packet loss
 - if it's a LAG connection, it could be my testing is hitting the wrong LAG
 member?

Sprint 4G LTE DNS intermittencies late at night
###############################################################
 I have been noticing a *lot*, lately -- one day in three-ish -- that my
 Sprint 4G phone will, for a lengthy but apparently random period between 0100
 and 0300EST, lose the ability to resolve DNS names using the resolvers that
 I am provided by Sprint.
 I think I reported a version of this before, but hadn't nailed down quite
 what was going on then.
 I have since found the SetDNS app, and proved that during these outages --
 during which FB and Twitter, frex, still worked, because they had internally
 cached the relevant server IPs, but web browsing would not and neither would 
 manual DNS lookup with testing tools -- if I used SetDNS to switch to, say,
 openDNS, then everything immediately started working.
 If I then disabled SetDNS and rebooted (cause there seems no way to get SetDNS
 to reset the addresses it found), it immediately broke again.
 So, is this poorly managed scheduled maintenance on *both* the resolvers
 that Sprint hands me?
 Or something else?
 Anyone else with Sprint LTE (non-Spark) in the Tampa or other markets who
 can confirm or deny?
 Cheers,
 -- jra

Verizon and Cogent packet loss
###############################################################
 Hi Everyone,
 Since no one has pointed it out yet, it looks like Verizon and Cogent has
 packet loss on the east half of the US.  Automated performance testing from
 keynote agents on Verizon connections for $DAYJOB sees this as well.

 Unfortunately this has been going on for many months between Cogent and Cogent's peers. We had to engineer around cogent because anytime one of our users tried to use a VPN to us, it was unusable.  From what I have heard, this is a business not a technical issue and isn't going to be resolved anytime soon. There have been periods where the loss is less, but generally > 0.

 We have seen this too, particularly through DFW.  Reports I get back 
 from both sides agree with the "business issue" diagnosis.  As such we 
 have moved all traffic toward Verizon away from Cogent links.

odd gmail issue.. inet6 ?
###############################################################
 I noticed on a couple of our mail servers, delivery to gmail was getting
 stuck in the outbound queue.  Our MTAs are all sendmail
 If I hardcode delivery to gmail to 74.125.142.26 via a mailertable
 entry, mail goes through fine
 But if let it naturally select the inet6 addr, it hangs
 Running /var/spool/mqueue/rBLDcRmZ092661 (sequence 1 of 1)

 I am coming from 2607:f3e0:80:80::2 in the above case
 tcpdump doesnt show anything obvious and since the payload is not
 readble I cant see it.  I wonder if there is a way to get sendmail to
 print out the contents...

 For the archives, I should have know this, but to get sendmail to spit
 out a little more of the exchange, a -d17 would have done the trick.
 eg  sendmail -q -qRdestuser at gmail.com -v -d17

Comcast residential in bay area

 My residential internet on Comcast started having high ping times and
 packet loss to the internet.   I rebooted my router, and now i have native
 IPv6 only.  I can not access IPv4 addresses.  Can anyone else in the Bay
 area on comcast replicate this?

 Hey Grant.
 I'm on Comcast up just fine on San Carlos, but my friend from up the street is down here now; issues with his comcast connect at home. His IP is in 24/8. I'm in 50.152.135/24. (it's been this way for 1+ year) He can ping his place 20ms from mine, but at the moment, nothing else.

 We have dozens of end-users down that utilize these, so they are
