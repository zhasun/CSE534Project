Verizon ATM outage in 228 LATA?
###############################################################
  We seem to be experiencing a Verizon outage in the Philadelphia area for ISP
 wholesale.  
 Just wondering if anyone has received a trouble ticket or anything?

weather.com issues - contacts?
###############################################################
 Folks,
 Anyone have any ops contacts over @ weather.com ?  We use a service they
 provide us (complete with custom hostnames) and...well...it's timing out a
 lot.
 As usual with these sorts of things, it's a years-gone-by setup done by
 people long gone....
 [note that it's definitely application side, anyway, not network. ;) but
 still breaking for us. ]

 They made some *major* changes to their site recently, you might have
 some direct links that no longer work. Just a thought...

Cogent issues in NY?

 Hello,
 Is anyone experiencing issues with web browsing on Cogent? For about an hour now, we're seeing intermittent slowness and page loads stalling. All other Internet connectivity seem to be fine. DNS appears to be working properly (and we're seeing the same issue if we use 4.2.2.2 or other public DNS.)
 We called Cogent support and they said there are no reported issues, but they are going to open a ticket and get back to us.

 Turns out Cogent is having a "backbone issue", according to the tech who called us back. ETR is unknown but evidently involves reseating something :)
 They must have re-routed traffic for now; we're back up to full speed.
 Thanks again to the folks who replied to my initial report!

 Can you point to a source URL, or is this known from some circuits 
 you have here?  I did (and still see) my home circuit to them down.
 My home circuit to Oceanic TW doesn't seem to be affected, though.

 Just a brief update.  Please direct any other conversation to 
 the discuss list...
 It does appear to be HT only.  My circuit to them was still down
 this morning as I left for work.  It was down all day yesterday (HST).
 No troubles with my Oceanic TW yesterday or this morning.  Also, I 
 have found nothing in the media or at the HT site, which doesn't seem 
 to be kept up to date any longer:

 This isn't an outage related issue - you have provided a traceroute with
 some reference to Cogent??
 A quick DIG of their domain name shows several different A records coming
 back for www.tcpdump.org:
 www.tcpdump.org.        60      IN      A       132.213.238.6
 www.tcpdump.org.        60      IN      A       178.77.96.193
 www.tcpdump.org.        60      IN      A       69.4.231.52
 One of those A records is the result of the traceroute you show below.  So
 what is the actual problem you are encountering?

 I'm seeing the exact same behaviour in traceroute.  I only tracerouted
 to 132.213.238.6, by the way, so the DNS RR A record stuff for
 tcpdump.org does not apply.
 !H means host unreachable as I'm sure you know.  Based on the IP address
 below (132.213.254.254, which looks like a router) returning !H, I would
 say the host 132.213.238.6 itself is down.
 Tried sending Email to any of the individuals listed in the WHOIS record
 for tcpdump.org?  I'd give that a shot first.

 Ummm... ok.
 I can pull up the site no problem today and was able to yesterday as well -
 and my DNS was resolving to 132.213.238.6
 The original poster simply asked "anyone seen this before?" - there was no
 indication of WHAT the problem was and how it's operationally impacting
 (therefore appropriate for this list as I would understand it).
 Just because you are seeing "host unreachable" doesn't mean that the content
 *behind* it won't be served.  Someone is doing some filtering on their
 router/firewall - pretty common stuff.
 Am I missing something here? ;)

 Just that a 50% loss rate and a *4 second* ping time aren't considered 
 'normal' for most networks.  ;)  (And are usually a sign of something 
 seriously wrong someplace...)  Oh: and 'host unreachable' isn't the same as 
 'filtered from the host': It means the previous hop doesn't know how to

 Fair enough... I can see the same thing from here as well but not having any
 issues reaching the site - is this kind of "outage" acceptable to this list?
 Perhaps I am misunderstanding the purpose of this list (I'm thinking major
 site outages, major network outages etc)?

 Yes I'm seeing 160 ms pings to my Chicago colo site a few blocks down my
 office. The office has cogent, colo has L3.

 Registrar & DNS provider Omnis.com (and domains served by them) appear to be offline.   I'm seeing sporadic connectivity to ns1.omnis.com and ns2.omnis.com from multiple points on the internet.   Depending on when I try, my traceroutes fail within both of their upstream networks, Level3 and Cogent.

 obvious what I meant from the trace. Sorry if it was confusing.

 Anyone else noticing continuing packet loss between L3 and GBLX? This
 has been going on and off for about 18 hours (more?).
 L3 and GLBX isn't it the same thing ?

 Owner wise, yes
 Network wise they are still semi-separate I believe (outside the US at
 least) , I have had recent conversations with people claiming L3 and GLBX
 as separate units (in the fact they could not deliver a GLBX circuit in an
 L3-lit building)

 Using both networks that is certainly our view from a European perspective. I believe only 1st line, provisioning and sales have integrated. Understandably it's a big job trying to integrate and am lead to believe not only will be a slow process but some network elements might never get there in any reasonable time span.

IPv6 access to some of the AAAA's for Facebook's websites
###############################################################
 Between 8:24 pm Central and 9:02 pm our monitoring system logged timeouts
 accessing some of the AAAA's Facebook's IPv6 websites:
 www.facebook.com
        2a03:2880:10:8f01:face:b00c:0:25
        2a03:2880:10:1f02:face:b00c:0:25
        2620:0:1c18:0:face:b00c:0:2
 www.v6.facebook.com
        2620:0:1cfe:face:b00c::3
 Did anyone else see anything?  All the other 30+ sites we monitor were clean
 nor for www.facebook.com <http://www.facebook.com's> 's
 2a03:2880:2110:3f01:face:b00c::.
 The WorldIPv6Launch site's graph shows a gap around that time (I assume the
 graph shows UTC)
