SAIX DNS outage?
###############################################################
  Hello,
 Does anyone have any information about an outage at the South African Internet
 Exchange, possibly DNS related?  Thank you.
 Regards,

 Aryeh,
 What's not clear whether yesterday's SAIX's DNS failure (over 70% of
 their users were impacted) was due to conficker. I haven't seen any
 evidence of that.
 Then again, SAIX's status page doesn't give a whole lot of information:
 http://www.saix.net/cgi-bin/saix_dns.pl

 Telkom's Internet help desk seems to be reachable on +27 27 201 0135.

fibre cut near 200 Paul, San Francisco
###############################################################
 Hey,
 I am hearing from multiple people about connectivity problems in the  
 bay area, and they all seem to have 200 Paul in common. ISC is  
 reporting a fibre cut between 529 Bryant, Palo Alto and 200 Paul, SF.  
 At least one Unitedlayer customer in 200 Paul seems to be off the air.
 Anybody know any specifics?

 Only thing I've heard is how Abovenet has a "supposed" fibre cut

 Could be related, then again might not be.

 My co-worker tells me there's been an announcement of the below fibre
 cut on 810AM radio this morning in the Bay, stating it's affecting AT&T,
 Verizon, Verizon Wireless, and other carriers.  The physical location
 of the cut has not yet been disclosed.
 So, the news/media is aware of the problem.
 Good to know they all have redundant circuits running through alternate
 locations and conduits.  *shakes head*

 Video of the cable cut itself indicates thieves may have been out
 "cutting for copper".  It's quite a clean cut (01:48 to 2:02):

 The video may also help someone determine the exact location and
 which of the two cuts it was.

 Clearly not the San Carlos cut - seems to be very close to
 W121.80542
 N37.25718
 Beginning of the ramp up from southbound Monterey Highway to
 Westbound Blossom Hill Road.
 There's a tree there in Google Earth - but you can see pieces of
 cut down tree in the video, and the lightpole which is in the nearby
 background up the ramp.

 As fashionable as it is to be paranoid, this does seem to fit the 'never 
 attribute to malice that which can be more easily explained by 
 stupidity' realm. IIRC, there have been a number of cases recently where 
 various fiber trunks (some of them aerial runs) have been cut by 
 miscreants looking for copper - they must have been so disappointed.....

 Even easier: walk down the street and look for anything visibly marked 
 with bright orange. Or look in manholes marked as telcom for the same. 
 It's likely to be fiber.

 Consider the ratio of accidental land-based cuts to intentional land-based cuts.  Then consider how hiding this data away exacerbates the already orders of magnitude more common and realistically troublesome problem.
 Don't neglect the ordinary (and just as damaging) for the infrequent and exraordinary.

 Additional news stories reporting second fiber cut on Sprint fiber

 was updated at 12:20pm with that information.
 San Jose cut at around 1:30am, San Carlos around 3:30am.

 Is there a notification board somewhere that tracks outages and restoration complete?

 Shane -
 I'm currently talking with few individuals (coders - volunteers)
 regarding building 'outages database' w/  e-mail/RSS update. This way we
 don't require members to log into a web service to check status.
 I want to be absolutely clear, outages database similar to the mailing
 list is not to hold ANYONE accountable      for an outage, its merely
 reporting on them and their status. This outages database will be for
 documented outages only.
 Unfortunately I don't know when this tool will be ready to use / test
 since these volunteers have full time jobs and having them to commit for
 a certain date is bit of a challenge but hopefully we'll work through it.
 Then again, I welcome donation whatever free time people can offer
 (coding wise) towards this project.
 If interested, please contact me directly and we can discuss off-line.
 regards,
 /virendra

Visualizing and confirming network anomalies - Newsight
###############################################################
 [Apologies to those on NANOG who already saw this. Given the recent
 discussion on this mailing list, it seemed appropriate to cross-post
 it here.]
 Hi folks,
 We've just released a new tool that allows you to see network problems
 from end-user machines, currently BitTorrent users. (Think of this as
 putting P2P traffic to good use.) The interface that we've provided is
 still very beta, but we'd appreciate any (constructive) feedback.
 A little more detail: we've deployed software called NEWS (network
 early warning system) that uses P2P users' natural traffic to detect
 sudden, unexpected drops in network performance -- this allows our 25k
 BitTorrent users to corroborate network problems with each other. Our
 tool, called Newsight, lets you see summaries of their reported
 network anomalies.
 You can browse a timeline of anomalies grouped by country, AS or
 prefix. You can also confirm known network problems, helping to create
 a public database of outages and their explanations.
 You can play with Newsight here:
 http://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/projects/news/newsight.html
 Cheers,
 Dave (on behalf of the Aqualab research group)

 It's a BIS outage, not BES (thankfully). All my users are just fine as well.

 We've seen voice, data, legacy AT&T and legacy SBC/PacBell circuits
