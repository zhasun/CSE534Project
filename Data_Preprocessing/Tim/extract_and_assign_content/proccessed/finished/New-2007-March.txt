 I received this from Verizon support earlier this evening (approx 7PM EST)
 There is a fiber cut in the Sacremento area that is affecting a
 number of our transit links in California, including traffic to and from
 our data center in San Jose.  Our NOC is actively rerouting traffic
 away from the affected region until the fiber can be repaired, so we
 may continue to see intermittent periods of network latency in the
 meantime.  We will send an update as soon as we have confirmation
 that these network issues have stabilized.
 According to Keynote's Internet Health, various networks (Verizon, NTT, XO,
 Qwest) are seeing increased latency on the West Coast.

 I had passed along the note about Verizon's fiber cut in Sacremento, but the
 issues (according to Keynote) were far more widespread than just Verizon's

 Richard,
 It appears Savvis has a scheduled maintenance between 06:00:00 - 2007
 March 10 & 11:00:00 (GMT) in Chicago & Illinois location. This could be
 causing service outages, latency, or other connectivity issues.

 Actually, I prefer that people use http://www.bgp4.net/rs and 
 http://www.bgp4.net/lg for those links.  Less typing, and if I redo the 
 wiki some day, the links will stay the same. :-)

Verizon Wireless Ohio/MI Outage?
###############################################################
 Hi folks;
 Many (around 90%) of the VZW Broadband access cards that I poll
 located in Northwest Ohio/Southern Michigan seem to be non responsive.
  It appears that they can make calls, but not receive them, and data
 cards seem to be affected as well.
 Is anyone else experiencing this?  VZW mentioned that there was an
 outage this morning (didn't affect me), but a soft reset should fix
 the problem.  So far, it hasn't.
 Best Regards;
 Ian

Link-Rank 1.0 alpha for visualizing BGP routing changes
###############################################################
 Dear all,
 Apologies if you have already received this. We recently released an  
 alpha version of Link-Rank 1.0 tool.
 Summary: Link-Rank works by weighing AS-AS links from each BGP router  
 by the number of BGP routes carried, and visualizes routing events as  
 changes in AS-AS link weights. Red edges represent loss of routes  
 while green edges represent gain of routes. The tool can currently  
 visualize data starting from January 1, 2007 from RouteViews' Oregon  
 collector, with a time lag of 1-2 hours.
 The tool can be downloaded from
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/link-rank/
 More information about the Link-Rank project can be found on the website
 http://linkrank.cs.ucla.edu/
 The new version has various improvements over existing version including
 1. Better handling of very large routing events.
 2. Ability to save and load graphs. Some sample events are included  
 in the "Examples" directory.
 3. Near real-time continuous visualization (This feature is being  
 tested and will be available in the beta release soon).
 4. Redesigned GUI based on feedback from previous release.
 We expect to move to beta release in a few weeks and would really  
 appreciate any bug reports or feature requests. The full source code  
 of the tool will be available with the beta release. We will also be  
 releasing a set of scripts and instructions to be able to use the  
 tool with your own BGP data.
 We hope you find this tool useful. Feel free to send us an email at  
 linkrankhelp-at-cs-dot-ucla-dot-edu
 Thanks
 Link-Rank team
 Mohit,
 Is this a linux based tool?
 Thanks
 Raman

 Sorry for not mentioning it in my mail, Its java based and works on  
 Linux. Feel free to contact me off the list if you run into any  
 problems.
 Thanks
