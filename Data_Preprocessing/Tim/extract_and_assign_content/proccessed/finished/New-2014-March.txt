Twitter intermittently broken
###############################################################
 Looks like twitter started giving a "something is technically wrong" error,
 just as @TheEllenShow live tweeted a photo from the Oscars.
 Doesn't seem to be happening for everyone, but certainly for a lot of
 people.
 Mobile client (at least on android) seems to be impacted also. Can tweet,
 but can't retrieve new ones.
 If the two events are related, nicely done, Ellen :-)

 My understanding is that there is a master-ticket open for a region-wide IP
 transmit, MPLS, VPLS and Layer-2 transport outage affecting Tallahassee,
 Florida region and varying state agencies.
 CTL has provided master ticket number 16736859 with no ETA available at
 this time.
 Just an FYI for any other SP's that may be experiencing issues with IP
 transit anywhere within the north Florida territory (and the State of
 Florida DMS systems).

 While not using facebook or twitter, those outages are at least technically

 It appears to have been a new issue, but possibly related to the previous one. Level(3) reported the following this morning:
 13:53 GMT<x-apple-data-detectors://1> - The IP NOC reports that protocol drops following a scheduled maintenance, GCR 7622319<tel:7622319>, in Detroit, MI impacted IP services. The issue existed on a connection between two of the routers in Detroit, MI. The IP NOC has disabled that connection to allow traffic to flow through alternate routes and eliminate the protocol drops.

 I suggest  you understand the baseline udp load of your network and do a
 flat 5x the baseline policer. This will capture attacks for dns, ntp,
 chargen and all the other sludge in udp.
 Udp sucks. Baseline, police, done.

 This will happen when there is a financial disincentive to maintain the
 status quo.
 That is, when ISPs who don't do this start getting sued for being
 complicit.

 Its not UDP's fault, its the amplifying effects of an open NTP server thats
 the issue, and NTP servers are in all kinds of places and having a secure
 config not an end user easy experience. Even things like JunOS run ntp as
 open by default.
 UDP is great for what its designed for, connectionless data exchanges...
 and TCP SYN attacks can be pretty big, and back in the old days ICMP smurf
 attacks were all the rage. Its also just a matter of time before someone
 discovers theres a common IPv6 based hack and enough v6 nodes in the world
 to do some damage.
 I'm also not convinced BCP38 will make the issue go away, it only takes a
 small number of ISPs to either not be implementing it or accidentally stop
 filtering and modern server and home broadband connection speeds are fast
 enough that a handful of bots can generate very large amounts of traffic. I
 think ISPs and upstreams need to be more proactive in identifying open NTP
 servers in their customers networks.

 those that are interested in getting a list of NTP amplifiers in their network can e-mail ntp-scan at puck.nether.net with their AS number in the subject line and get a list of NTP and DNS amplifiers in your network.
 As of 2014-03-07 there were:
 127,621 hosts that responded to "ntpdc -n -c monlist 192.0.2.1? (MONLIST query)
 4,355,475 hosts that responded to "ntpq -c rv 192.0.2.1? (version query)
 You can also search any /22 up to /32 online at the OpenNTPProject.org website.

Comcast<->AT&T packet loss (possibly within CA)
###############################################################
 Since roughly Friday, I've been seeing what appears to be packet loss
 somewhere within Comcast/AT&T network mesh.  Source and destination IPs
 are provided below as well, ditto with some mtrs from src->dst and
 dst->src.  I keep periodic mtrs (both directions) going all the way back
 to 03/04.  I can make all of those logs available if asked.
 The issue started on 03/07 @ 21:33 PST suddenly -- not a "gradual"
 increase -- and lasted until an undetermined time (very hard to tell
 from mtrs) but I'd estimate ~02:00 PST on 03/08 (today).
 The issue then appeared to start back up again ~07:00 PST, though it's
 hard to give an exact time (seems sort of a gradual increase, thus hard
 to pinpoint).  It's been ongoing since.
 The loss varies from 3% to 20%, but you can definitely "feel" it across
 an SSH session, so it's not ICMP prio.
 I will make myself clear: it's very hard to "show" someone the way this
 problem manifests itself, because the packet loss will vary all over the
 place between different hops.  It *definitely* starts at a particular
 point and "trickles down", but due to the fact that the loss is a
 smaller percentage, there are times where a hop will suddenly show 0%.
 TL;DR -- You'd really have to see a longer log (say, an hour's worth) to
 be able to say "ah yes, this really is a problem" and not blow it off as
 ICMP prio.
 And as usual, there's one of those "mystery routers" (hop #8 in the
 first example) that peering providers looooooove to use as a scapegoat
 when it comes to shifting blame, ex. provider A says "that's a device
 owned by provider B", provider B says "that device is provider A's
 responsibility", and neither side does anything about the issue.
 However I should note that the "mystery router" usually does show some
 degree of loss even when this issue isn't occurring (likely ICMP prio on
 the device), but that makes it even more difficult to determine where
 the issue begins.

 A couple of things
 - Hop 8's IP is an AT&T so likely an interface on an AT&T router, since you're headed towards it in your traceroute (next_hop).
 - Have you tried something like hping that will allow you to use TCP for your test?
 - Have you contacted InterNAP and told them to open a ticket with AT&T to open a ticket with AT&T using the data you have?

 1. Thanks -- the problem is that in my experience Company X will blame
 Company Y for the device, but the device is owned/maintained by Company
 X, and this nonsense goes on for about a week before someone finally
 owns up to something (by which time the problem is usually gone).  It's
 a depressing and sad modus operandi; sometimes I think it's done
 intentionally (stall tactic).
 2. No, because I don't think it's necessary -- when I can clearly "feel"
 the slowdown via SSH (which is TCP-based) the issue isn't related to
 ICMP prio.  Plus, showing a network provider hping results doesn't
 necessarily convince them of anything if they're unfamiliar with the
 tool.  That's been my experience anyway.  It'd be akin to giving them
 packet captures and doing a 10-page write-up showing how TCP packet with
 PSH+ACK seq no 123456789 wasn't seen by the remote end until 2-3
 retries.
 3. No I haven't, because the process would be significantly more
 convoluted than that.  This is what would have to happen, starting with
 the forward path:
 - I'd have to open a ticket with Comcast through standard 800-COMCAST
   means, i.e. complaining to someone in the Philippines about packet
   loss (read: likelihood of someone screwing this up: 99% likely)
 - Comcast would have to hand it off to the Comcast NOC
 - Comcast NOC would have to care enough to open a ticket with AT&T
 For the reverse path:
 - I'd have to open a ticket with my VPS provider, RootBSD
 - RootBSD would have to open a ticket with InterNAP (assuming they have
   relationship with them directly; it may be more convoluted, for
   example it may be they have to open a ticket with their co-lo
   provider who then opens a ticket with InterNAP)
 - InterNAP would have to care enough to open a ticket with
   Qwest/Centurylink
 - Qwest/Centurylink would have to care enough to open a ticket with
   Comcast
 Historically I've mailed things of this nature to outages at outages.org
 because there are lurkers on the list who quietly go behind the scenes
 and start trying to fix/rectify things.  Other times it's purely about
 bringing to light something that's happening on the Internet in hopes
 that one or more of the involved peers are, in a roundabout way,
 publicly shamed for not having better monitoring.
 P.S. -- Issue is still ongoing and appears worse than before (at least
 now there aren't sporadic times of 0% loss at intermediary hops).

 Jeremy,
 For the record, we at Internap do take connectivity issues seriously.
 I'd suggest having your provider reach out to our NOC, so that we may
 investigate comprehensively.  You (and others on this list) are, of
 course, welcome to mail me privately in addition.
 (FWIW: a quick look into 76.96.0.0/11 in Dallas shows we've not been
 routing to it over any of Comcast's congested paths.)

Zayo/Abovenet Issues in SF Bay Area
###############################################################
 Heads up -- we're seeing a repeat of the Zayo/Abovenet issues again in
 the Bay Area.
 Paths beyond mpr4.sjo7.us.above.net seem to be seeing 75+% packet loss.
 Happy Monday, everyone! :p
 Cheers,
 jof
 After tracing some more, I could re-summarize as "paths beyond
 cr2.sjc2.us.above.net"

 Confirmed from AS32354 as well, we had to deeper them again.

 I was experiencing issues with Zayo Sunday afternoon well into the evening
 between ae4.cr2.lga5.us.above.net (NY) and ae6.cr2.ord2.us.above.net (CHI).
 Again.

 Zayo master ticket number TTN-0000412519, Zayo indicates they cannot reach
 the device and that it is a different problem than last week's outage.

 Got a complaint about slowness from my ATT MIS client's, I just looked 
 around and noticed that this encountering packet loss and I am unable to 
 reproduce it to any other network.
 Also tested from a Zayo fiber connection at another office.
 is anyone else experiencing an issue with level3 in LA?

 Does L3's LG come in handy for reproducing the issue?  It might not
 given how packets flow (e.g. the loss is across a specific interface),
 but you might spend 15 minutes or so poking at it:

 I had done this earlier, forgot to paste it, current results from 
 Tustin, CA to 4.2.2.2
 I also have presence in One Wilshire and 800 S Hope, I don't think we 
 see the level3 issue there.
 I think the route has to do with Tustin > LA, every trace that has 
 replied to this thread has been through an alternate route.
 Thanks.

 Your 1st traceroute shows loss happening within the Los Angeles region
 possibly within Level3 (hop #8 from the look of it, and it looks like
 multipathing is involved).  Because traceroutes going only one direction
 are provided (due to the destination you chose and the nature of
 asymmetric routing), only half of the picture is shown, which is why I
 say "possibly".
 Your 2nd traceroute shows two things;
 - Loss showing up starting at hop #3 (possibly within Zayo/Abovenet
   space, again "possibly", re: asymmetric routing)
 - Loss showing up at hop #8 (could be an effect of something happening
   earlier in the path)
 For reference, here are your traceroutes:
 https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2014-March/006787.html
 So when you say "I think it's a problem with Tustin > LA", the 2nd
 traceroute you provided doesn't seem to support that theory, nor the
 statement "I am unable to reproduce it to any other network".
 Do you have any other tools available to you, like mtr?  mtr won't
 narrow down where the issue is happening, but would make it more clear
 as to where the issue is happening, especially if you let it run for a
 while (say 10 minutes or so) from both places (you didn't provide source
 IPs for either traceroute, so that doesn't help either).

 We couldn't ping one IP in Tustin from the outside (was able to ping 
 from same network) from 6:45am- 8:05am PST.
 Problem went away around 8:15 AM PST.
 Weird that only one IP was affected.

 Stu,
 I figured they would redirect to brocade's site, since it seems people are still trying to hit the site.
 Domains seem pretty cheap to me.

 I guess it came back online, then went down again. They are waiting on a

 Level3 has sourced a nearby spare routing engine (being borrowed from
 another router) with no ETA. Original replacement is still en-route via air
 and will replace the borrowed equipment.

 Sorry for spamming the mailing list repeatedly, but our ticket with Level3

 stable.

Amazon AWS issues from Montreal/Toronto/New York
###############################################################
 Anyone have trouble with Amazon AWS from the East Coast? We're receiving the routes from AS16509 from Tiscali in Montreal and I wasn't even able load status.aws.amazon.com. I can load amazon.com (HTML and CSS) but all the static images served from Cloudfront are not loading at all.
 We directly peer with Amazon at the NYIIX for Cloudfront so I tried to flip the traffic from it through our HE link in NYC by deactivating the direct session with Amazon, no go so far.
 Thanks

 Turns out our Tiscali link is the culprit. The return-path from AS16509 was through Tiscali.. opening a ticket with them.

 I can reach the site (and was able to earlier when this mail came in),
 as in I was able to connect to www.stamps.com (216.52.211.93) TCP port
 80 without any trouble.
 traceroutes seem worthless since their border routers filter ICMP.

Yup; Google Hangouts/Talk is down.

 Confirming Gtalk problems from Road Runner Biz in Pinellas Co, Fl.;
 was offline, can't get a connection.
 And here is evidence that the Googlers don't understand ... Timezones!
 These times appear to be EDT, even though Google's based in Cali.

 Odd.  The issue was just in Chrome.  The fix was to sign everyone out of
 their Gmail accounts, then sign them back in.  Four people at the same
 time.  Oh well.

 This is the same cable that broke many times in the past causing internet
 issues in Asia. The timeframe coincides with few of us in Thailand noticing
 slow internet when accessing Japanese/US hosts. At first look
 ping/traceroute doesnt show higher latency.
 Anyone have any additional info?

 There are 2 faults. One on S6 and one on S4, with estimated repairs completed on April 4 and April 8, respectively.
 Links I find useful:
 http://submarinenetworks.com/systems/intra-asia/apcn-2/apcn-2-submarine-cable-system
 http://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/submarine-cable/apcn-2
 Even though Thailand isn't directly connected via APCN-2, your service could be affected by congestion of upstream carriers managing their traffic. Care to share a traceroute to the Japan and US destinations for which you see higher latency?
