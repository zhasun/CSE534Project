 It took a week, but it's now fixed.  I reached out (repeatedly) to both Turner and XO, and one of those two likely fixed it.  Something between hop 7 and 8 was likely the culprit.

 FYI For the last few months Qwest ATM services are at or beyond capacity in
 and out of Eastern Oregon. Ridiculously slow at times or just completely
 times out. But  I don?t know if this has anything to do with Qwest in Boise.
 DSL customers here are not happy. ETR is MAY 2011. Coincidently the Century
 Link merger is final in April 2011. So it?s hard to say the ETR will be on
 time.

 The outage here Boise was caused by a core router failure in the Boise CO during maintenance, or so Qwest claims. I suspect the maintenance corrupted the routing tables from the behavior we saw (some parts of the Internet accessible, others not).

 That defies every common understanding of "SONET ring".  Better to call it
 "linear STS connection" then. =)

 Not really...
 A SONET Ring can provision circuits with or without a protect path. Circuits
 which are built with a protect path are not affected by a single cut. Circuits
 which are built without a protect path can be affected by a single cut, but,
 leave the other side of the ring available to other circuits.
 It's not uncommon for a carrier to (and quite reasonably so) charge more
 for a protected circuit.
 This configuration can be done on a per-circuit basis. The SONET itself
 is still a ring, whether any particular circuit on that ring is groomed for
 protection or not.

 While you're technically correct, it's not how it's commonly implemented.
 Well, maybe it's more common than I was aware. =)  It's not how regional and
 state fiber networks in our neck of the woods do it.

 Concur.  If a customer buys a "ring" they expect a ring.  Protection is
 implied.  If they buy a point-to-point, that is a different story.  A
 protected point-to-point might be provisioned on a ring or it might be
 provisioned with two separate point-to-point circuits.
 A "SONET ring failure" would require two faults.  That said, I have seen
 cases where both sides of the ring enter a building by the same trench
 allowing one case of backhoe fade to take out the entire building.

 english.aljazeera.net appears to have some form of RR set up, since
 the IP addresses everyone is getting back for it vary greatly.  "dig
 any" doesn't help here, but the A record TTL is quite low (something
 like 180 seconds).
 Example:
 ;; QUESTION SECTION:
 ;english.aljazeera.net.         IN      A
 ;; ANSWER SECTION:
 english.aljazeera.net.  752     IN      CNAME english.aljazeerait.net.c.itmdb.net.
 english.aljazeerait.net.c.itmdb.net. 83 IN A    206.33.63.124
 So let's do an actual real test:
 $ curl -v -i -s -S -H "Host: english.aljazeera.net" http://86.62.248.78:80/
 * About to connect() to 86.62.248.78 port 80 (#0)
 *   Trying 86.62.248.78...
 So, that server/whatever in the RR list is obviously busted, or the
 network surrounding it is.

AT&T <-> Level3 Packet Loss in SF Bay Area
###############################################################
 We've been observing a small about of intermittent packet loss to/from
 AT&T and Level3 here in the San Francisco Bay Area this morning. In
 examining the situation, it seems like a evenly-spaced dropping of
 packets to certain IPs.
 This appears to end users like some IPs on destination networks are
 reachable, while some adjacent ones are not.
 I suspect this is due to a failed LAG leg or ECMP leg on Level3's side.
 We were able to route around the problem for now.
 Cheers,
 jof

 Have you seen this issue with any other carriers? We have seen a *very*

 we've never been able to track it down to any "for sure" type of

 Hrm. That's been my solution for this type of problem as well: just
 temporarily switch providers in both directions. This can be a little
 tricker if course if you're not a directly-downstream customer of the
 affected transit AS.
 I've been able to identify this problem by running mtr or traceroute
 simultaneously to several (at least 16+) IPs that are adjacent in a
 remote network and seeing different source IPs coming back for the
 ICMP type 11/code 0 (TTL Exceeded in transit) responses, and
 correlating loss to some subset of those IPs. Of course control plane
 policing or loaded CPUs on remote routers can confound these numbers.
 I feel like MTR does this especially well.
 Hope that helps. Good luck. Enjoy your routers.
 I see some problems too with our level3 connection.

 Have you seen this issue with any other carriers? We have seen a *very*
 similar issue with several Comcast-announced routes in the Midwest and
 we've never been able to track it down to any "for sure" type of
 problem.

 According to Level 3
 They have routed traffic from the problem module in the switch, and high
 CPU utilization has dropped. They are currently checking with their
 customers to confirm improvement.

 Hrm. That's been my solution for this type of problem as well: just
 temporarily switch providers in both directions. This can be a little
 tricker if course if you're not a directly-downstream customer of the
 affected transit AS.
 I've been able to identify this problem by running mtr or traceroute
 simultaneously to several (at least 16+) IPs that are adjacent in a
 remote network and seeing different source IPs coming back for the
 ICMP type 11/code 0 (TTL Exceeded in transit) responses, and
 correlating loss to some subset of those IPs. Of course control plane
 policing or loaded CPUs on remote routers can confound these numbers.
 I feel like MTR does this especially well.
 Hope that helps. Good luck. Enjoy your routers.

 Got a couple of VPNs and using different ISPs to Australia from the UK and
 they are struggling at the moment.
 Seems to be as soon as we hit Asianetcom.net looking at the traceroutes, the
 San Jose link is very much worse than the the LAX connections.
 Could be as a result of the events off the japanese coast I would suggest
 but if anyone has anymore info would be appreciated

 I can confirm JUS (both North and South) are impacted with no ETA for repair.
 If anyone has additional details on specific cable systems or landing stations impacted it would helpful.

Dreamhost outage?

 Folks,
 Anyone aware of what's going on with Dreamhost?  There is apparently an outage there but no updates on their Twitter feed or other status site.  Can't get to http://www.dreamhost.com/ from where I'm at on the network.
 I ask because the CrisisCommons wiki on the Japan Quake is hosted there and volunteers can't access it:
 http://wik?i.crisisco?mmons.org/?wiki/Honsh?u_Quake
 (And per Twitter, it seems that Dreamhost sites are unavailable from much of the Internet.)

 I can get to the status page(it took a long time to load).  For those that can't load it, here is what it says:
 Network outage
 Posted (March 14th, 2011 at 2:20 am PST) by patrickm 
 We apologize for the downtime as our core network is offline at the moment. Our network admin is addressing the issue and we expect service to resume shortly. This will prevent access to the customer web panel.
 Update: This issue is now resolved! This was due to network maintenance which was not supposed to have any effect on connectivity, but sadly did. We are investigating this more thoroughly and if we have any additional info to provide, it will be posted here! Thanks for your patience with this outage. Please contact Support if you are still experiencing any issues.
 Update 5:41 am (Pacific): We apologize, as we are experiencing another outage. Our network admin is working on the issue at this time and we expect it to be resolved shortly. This outage will affect core services such as the Web Panel and WebMail. We will update this post as soon as we have more information or when the issue is resolved!
 Update 7:11 am: We are currently operating on half of a core, so partial connectivity has been restored. We are working to resolve an issue with one of the cisco core supervisors not maintaining it?s configuration. Systems that are affected by this are our servers located at our downtown Los Angels, CA location (including the panel)? servers at our LAX data center are not affected by this outage.

 Correct, we've seen significant issues with BT specifically; to the 
 point that we've shutdown peering with them.  So far this has resolved 
 most of the reported problems.

 Victor,
 Thank you for the info. I'm assuming you are in the SF Bay area?
 I ask because we have a site in SF that is pretty much on dial-up speeds 
 with anything that has to hop routes involving Global Crossing.

Can anyone else confirm slow web page loads of ipv6.comcast.com
###############################################################
 I?ve been in contact with an internal Comcast contact, but it would be
 helpful if others could confirm or deny that web page loads of
 ipv6.comcast.com are slow (yes, you'll need IPv6 access to test -- and yes,
 I have native, non-tunneled access).  I?ve measured load times of 1.5 to 2.5
 minutes.  There?s two AAAA records, so you many need to use wget to be aware
 of which one you're hitting.
 The issue started around 3:10 pm Central.  The other 10 IPv6 sites I monitor
 aren't having issues.

 >From HE takes approximately 60-120 seconds for each connection to ipv6.comcast.com
 to start loading data. Data loads at normal speed thereafter.
 However, this affects each element and each redirect. There are about 4 redirects between
 http://ipv6.comcast.com and actually getting data back and about 20 elements that comprise
 the page once you get there, so, it takes a LONG time to get to the point of seeing anything
 on the page.

 Anyone seeing issues in this last week (and continuing periodically)
 with Google Apps hosted email and Google Docs?  We've seen multiple
 times were servers gave 500 errors, email servers wouldn't respond and
 more ... all from a variety of locations and different users/Internet
 connections.
 Thanks!

 Yes. More and more frequent lately. So unreliable that we're going
 back to Exchange.

 On that note I have an ISP account and several businesses with Apps.  No

 The errors I saw were from our own business edition.

 ? which erases the cookie and logs you out of all your accounts
 at once.
 Then I relog into all my accounts in the right order (seriously,
 it has to be by login order? it can't be by account name?  You
 can't bookmark the right account unless you login in the right
 order?)
 Then a day or two later it fails in some novel way and I have to
 log out and relog all my accounts ? again ?

 I keep hoping they'll get their shit together with the multiple
 login cookies eventually, but it's been like a year, so I just
 use the workaround.
 Perhaps it's something like that?

 I have seen it almost daily on some users, and never see it on others. 
 It's all part of Google's restructuring, and is much more browser related 
 than it is an outage. For instance, I very seldom see a problem with 
 chrome or IE users, and see it very often with Firefox and Safari users.

netflix streaming, browsing down for the last 30 minutes, now DVD shipping too
###############################################################
 At first I was getting connection resets.  18 minutes ago:
 "We?re sorry, the Netflix website and the ability to instantly watch
 movies are both temporarily unavailable."
 I don't have a quote but it went on to stress DVD shipping operations
 were still up and running.  Now the shipping is down as well:
 "We are sorry, the Netflix website and our DVD shipping operations are
 temporarily down.
 Our engineers are working hard to bring the site and shipping
 operations back up as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience
 and, again, we apologize for the inconvenience. If you need further
 assistance, please call us at 1-877-445-6064."
 Cheers,
 Dave Hart
 Down here too, since at least 7:25 EDT (UTC-4).

 Thanks for the confirmation and report it started hours earlier.
 They've changed the error message to a third variant now, not
 mentioning the DVD shipping at all (which is what I would have
 expected from the beginning, really):
 "We are sorry, the Netflix website and the ability to instantly watch

 It sounds global, but I note I'm coming from a Clearwire 4G connection
