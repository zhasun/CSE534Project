Comcast Fiber in WA State...
###############################################################
  A routing issue in a Seattle core router impacting 14 network nodes 
 serving Comcast circuits from Portland to the Canadian border are having 
 issues.
 No hardware failures have been identified.
 The issue appears to be exclusively layer 2 routing.
 Comcast has, of course, engaged their highest level engineers who are 
 presently "all-hands-on-deck" working to resolve this issue.
 There is no firm ETR as of yet.

 Any follow-up to this?  Just curious.

 Sorry for the lack of followup.
 Service was down for us from 1600 (on the dot) until 2035. We are a 
 customer of a customer so we don't have direct access to Comcast for 
 details.
 One of our POPs is at a K20 network site supported by Comcast EPL. They 
 dropped off around 1700 and came back around the same time.

Pac-West Outage

 Does anyone see a Pac-West outage? DID's are failing... tried to call 
 (213) 325-0000 on their site also and it just hangs up.
 Thanks
 We got a notice from Voip Innovations a few hours ago:
    - I NOC has recently become aware of an issue affecting all inbound
    traffic to DIDs on the PacWest network. Calls to these DIDs are failing to
    a fast busy, dead air, or a not in service message. This issue was
    originally reported around 0925 EDT (1325 GMT) and is currently under
    investigation by the carrier. Below is the most recent correspondence from
    the carrier:
    SERVICE AREA EFFECTED: ALL
    NETWORK EVENT: Service Impairment
    IMPACT OF EVENT: All calls failing to fast busy or dead air
    We are working diligently to resolve the issue, and are committed to
    minimizing impact to your business and will restore service as quickly as
    possible. You will receive an additional notification when the event is
    resolved along with additional details regarding follow-up actions.
    If you are unsure if your DID(s) are affected, you may locate the
    Provider information in the back office under DIDs > My DIDs > My Local
    DIDs by looking under the Network column, or open a ticket through the back
    office or by emailing support at voipinnovations.com
    We will continue to monitor this issue and provide updates as they are
    received from the carrier.

Pac West Outage
###############################################################
 Update from Pac West as of 6:30 pm Pacific time today:
 Please see most recent notice from upper management regarding the current
 outage:
 The commercial power was cut off this morning and the batteries did not
 hold long enough for the generator to come on and take over the load.  (we
 will investigate and replace the batteries ASAP)
 The network team have been there all day building the network components
 back and bringing it back online
 Unfortunately, when the network went down one router did not come back up.
 The team has switched out the router and is now building the connections
 back between the new router and the network.
 Don?t have an ETA yet, but appear to be getting down the home stretch.

 Sounds like a single-router deployment model with no onsite (like) spares ? if so, they could have swapped in the routers/line cards and restored service much more quickly?.I wonder if the router that didn?t come back up was one of the Cisco memory-afflicted ones.

 I guess I am very surprised there seems to be little redundancy in their
 systems. Ideally a second physical facility but I'd settle for redundant
 routers at this point.

 Is there any source of actual info from PacWest?  No status updates on

Centurylink WA-OR fiber cut.
###############################################################
 Apparently a large cable stretching between Astoria, Oregon and Washington
 state (presumably the Megler bridge) was cut ~12:40am Pacific.  Clink crews
 started splicing around 5:00am.  They completed the Oregon side of the
 splice at 1:00pm and will be complete with the Washington side around
 8:00pm local time.  This has affected some, but not all, of my NW Oregon
 QMOE circuits.  Clink group ticket #157259.

 Level3 has some switch upgrades scheduled for June30th/July1st AM (1-3AM EST) out of 111 8th. That's an Internet POP there for them.
 Haven't seen anything today having problems out of 111 8th though, and we've got a ton of circuits supporting Wall St. out of there. No info on Chicago though.
 Hope this helps.

 Hi Outages,
 We have been receiving reports from users all over the country that they have been failing to connect to our application. For other users everything is working fine. Our application is hosted at Latisys(static.oak01.latisys.net) in Chicago. I myself am experiencing mixed connectivity issue's. I can connect to one of my IP's at Latisys, but not the other. Tracert's indicate that packet is getting to their network.

 Hi Outages,
 We have been receiving reports from users all over the country that they
 have been failing to connect to our application. For other users everything
 is working fine. Our application is hosted at
 Latisys(static.oak01.latisys.net) in Chicago. I myself am experiencing mixed
 connectivity issue's. I can connect to one of my IP's at Latisys, but not
 the other. Tracert's indicate that packet is getting to their network.
 Does not work for me:

 I'm on the phone now with the Network Architect at my hosting provider, but

 their providers. Anyone have any information?

 Shouldn't you open a support ticket with your provider?
 This looks like a problem specifically with your service that they provide,
 rather than a wider outage..?

 Feedly has been under attack for a while and they aren?t using good DDoS mitigation providers, it?s probably getting hit periodically. ?Also, it seems that their authentication mechanisms are fragile. ?The oAuth seems to break periodically on their end.

 We were seeing an odd issue reaching a site in Texas via TATA out of 
 ORD.  Via JFK and Cogent, all seemed OK.  The odd thing is that the 
 packets not getting to the site were protocol specific ?!?! I figured it 
 was a firewall issue at the CPE end. Perhaps broken QoS or load 
 balancing something or another ?
 It started at 06:08 GMT-4 (East coast time)

 There are a few VZW reps in this reddit thread chiming in with more details:
 http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/298yt9/verizon_wireless_customers_have_been_unable_to/
 Customer facing issues include being unable to activate/change service, and if you dial #MIN to check your usage, instead of the automated system you?re being forwarded to a representative who can?t tell you much.
 I can?t vouch for it?s authenticity, but I?ve seen this in a few places now:

 You'll probably want to hit HE's looking glass in the future as well (
 http://lg.he.net). I'm not sure which router(s) AT&T peers with, but it
 wouldn't be too hard to figure out. Also, I apologize for the lop-sidedness
 of their looking glass... When I wrote it while working at HE I didn't
 expect the network to grow quite as much; were I still there I'd fix it ;-)
