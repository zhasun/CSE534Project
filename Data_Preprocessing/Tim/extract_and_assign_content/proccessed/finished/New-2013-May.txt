Issues with Earthlink/STS in Florida
###############################################################
  Anyone know what the issues are with Earthlink/STS in Florida? I have
 multiple circuits down, and the only info I've been able to get out of
 Earthlink is that "hundreds of customers" have been affected and they have
 no ETR. I haven't been able to get a master ticket number or a conference
 bridge number out of anyone.  I just was on hold for over 30 minutes trying
 to get a hold of someone to talk to.
 This is affecting both my legacy and data circuits.
 Thanks folks, and sorry for the noise.
 -Eric

Centurylink nationwide outage
###############################################################
 Saw our Centurylink Ethernet circuit lose L3 connectivity in SWFL around 0400 EDT. 
 ANS/ABS states it's a nationwide routing issue. No ETR.
 >From what I've heard its about 10 states affected, mostly legacy
 Centurylink/embarq
 Seems to be affecting DSL, T1 on our end, and from what you've said
 ethernet as well.

 Been down and out for the count here in Kansas City on AS22186 (Legacy 
 Embarq/Sprint) / 76.7.0.0/19 since around 3AM central time. The routing 
 within CenturyLinks' network still appears to be functional (DSL 
 customers), but anything outside of a local region with CenturyLink 
 appears to not function.
 Unfortunately, I've not much more to say than that. =/

 Sounds like it was scheduled maintenance gone bad:
 	"Perrine said he spoke with CenturyLink at 6 a.m. 
 	where they advised him the company was doing scheduled
 	maintenance. At 7:35 a.m. they told him something
 	had gone wrong during the maintenance and it was
 	affecting customers in 13 states."

 e-affecting-local-internet-provider?nclick_check=1
 I bite my tongue in regards to Network Tallahasee's singlehomedness and
 Perrine's comment on his questioning of the timing of the update. 
 I encourage all my competitors to stay single homed and to do their
 maintenance Sunday morning, while their vendors are at their lowest staffing
 levels.

 Same thing happened in Monroe LA that took down all of north Louisiana. It
 was an update that went bad and the switch had to be manually checked line
 by line. No backup was done before the maintenance. 16 hours of downtime
 about 45 days ago.

  Sorry to everyone, I should have had more info for you from the start.
 The locations that we were getting reports from seam to be mostly on the
 east coast (Virginia, New Jersey, New York).  This was not a complete
 internet outage for them, it seams that there was a route that was down
 somewhere in between them and us in Walla Walla, Washington.  As of right
 now everyone has reported back saying that the issue has been resolved. I
 would post some trace routes but they are all going through now.
 Again sorry for the lack of information on my first post.

 I'm seeing intermittent behaviour -- sometimes it works, sometimes it
 doesn't.
 "Doesn't" means HTTP headers get returned, but actual content does not,
 despite Content-Length saying so.  The TCP socket gets abruptly closed
 before actual content can be returned.  Proof:
 $ curl -i -I -s -v http://www.frontier.com/
 * About to connect() to www.frontier.com port 80 (#0)
 *   Trying 66.133.172.205...

 I would say this is a webserver/host problem on Frontier's side.  Maybe
 someone should introduce them to IIS's /REBOOTONERROR flag.  ;-)

trouble at AWS US-EAST-1a?
###############################################################
 I've had major network connectivity issues with about 10 to 15% of my
 instances in zone "A" at Amazon's US-EAST-1 region this morning.
 The instances are trucking away, but the networking is
 down/flapping/unreliable like crazy on that minority percentage.
 Anyone else seeing anything like this?

 That status board doesn't show any problems (http://status.aws.amazon.com/).
  Keep in mind that the zone letters differ between accounts so zone A for
 you could be zone C for someone else.

 Currently connected to an instance in us-east-1 with a PPTP VPN endpoint
 running on the instance, no problems.
 I'd provide the availability zone, but my understanding is that they don't
 correlate across AWS accounts.

 Hi Blair,
 I am not observing any issues in US East.
 FYI your 1a, may not be 1a for others.

 Right.  And I have a question about that.  To wit:
 When AWS posts outages, like the one around this time last year that
 affected to AZs, they named them by letter (b and d if memory serves).  But
 I was viewing that page from a friend's computer who doesn't use AWS, and I
 wasn't signed in.  So how do we know which "B" is "B" and which "D" is "D"
 when they give AZ outage reports?
 Anyone have any insight into this?

 Not seeing anything like this at this time and I have instances in ALL EAST AZ?s.
 However, it?s quite common to see networking hiccoughs on some instances in an AZ that mysteriously come and go lasting from seconds to tens of minutes..

Charter - Cleveland, TN
###############################################################
 Good Morning!
 Any other providers seeing any outages with Charter Communications? We have
 a significant portion of our Charter originated customer base that can't
 reach our cloud network/datacenter/pops nationally.
 Doesn't appear as though any of our clients, specifically tested in the
 Cleveland, TN region have internet access and all of the toll-free numbers
 are currently ringing busy.
 Our customers are also reporting that their online portals are stating
 "Session Expired - please re-authenticate" and "Charter eOnline is
 currently unavailable. We are working to restore access. You may try again
 later or if you would like to make a payment now, click here to chat with a
 live Agent or call 1-888-438-2427. We appreciate your patience.", in a
 vicious cycle...With, again, that specific toll-free number responding with
 a busy signal and the live Agent chat application not loading at any
 customer's sites from alternate internet connections...
 Kindly,
 Kraig Beahn

IPv6 tunnels in FRA1 on HE.net down?
###############################################################
  <20130424022850.GA19274@lxr.su>
 This just happened again:  all IPv6 tunnels on tserv1.fra1.he.net.
 were inaccessible; from within a tunnel, cannot access any IPv6
 resource, other than ordns.he.net, which runs on the tunnel server
 itself.
 Why does FRA1 loses IPv6 connectivity so often?
 Update: Seems like it has been resolved as I've been writing this
 email, but this would seem to happen a few times too many.

WorldNIC/Network Solutions DNS or network issues?
###############################################################
 Came across this one right now (21:48 PDT (UTC-0700)) while trying to
 look up some tracking information on an Ontrac package I have.  Ontrac
 uses WorldNIC/Netsol as their authoritative nameservers.
 I wasn't able to resolve www.ontrac.com from my Comcast connection at
 home (Mountain View, CA), while I saw intermittent DNS failures when
 trying to do resolution from my VPS (Sylmar, CA), so I poked at things a
 bit.  First from my VPS:
 $ host www.ontrac.com
 www.ontrac.com has address 12.38.237.1
 Host www.ontrac.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
 And now from home:

 Obviously I don't have return path traces.
 I repeated the digs from my VPS, and they work but only intermittently.
 So I'm guessing some kind of GSLB or network interface round-robining
 may be impacting things, but only via some routes/paths.
 Sorry if I've forgotten some information or a step, doing too many
 things at once right now... :-)

 This seems to have resolved itself in some manner of speaking; things
 this morning seem fine.
 Also, I embarrassingly made an octet typo when testing against one of
 the nameservers (205 != 206); I have a tendency to type things in
 manually rather than copy-paste (old habits die hard):

 Looks like a Comcast Interconnect issue.  Out of Chicago, seeing Outages 
 to a Comcast circuit in Atlantic City via Telia (at a Chicago handoff), 
 but Fine to Dekalb, Il, via Global crossing, and Northern Indiana via 
 savvis.

 I heard that there was a 288-count fiber cut this afternoon thanks to a
 Fedex truck in Chicago. That might be related, but I'm not sure. I don't
 have any more details than that, unfortunately.

 I have no explanation how they could possibly be down for more than a day, 
 even if only on IPv6; perhaps only he.net is affected?

 So, this is only fb.me that's affected, not www.facebook.com.
 Doubtful that only he.net customers are affected, probably a
 world-wide issue.

 Seems ICMP traceroute should work to them, at least for IPv4.
 I can try from another destination if needed.
 Can you determine if this is a IPv6 vs. IPv4 thing?

 Works fine over v4, just fails on v6.  I connect to the same IPv6 address.

 I have no explanation how they could possibly be down for more than a day, 
 even if only on IPv6; perhaps only he.net is affected?

 Dunno about you, but my non-happy-eyeballs browser takes a couple of

 issue yesterday, which, if true, would be quite amusing for a site so

 Since becoming IPv6-enabled, this is by far not the first site that's
 stopped working at some point in time for me, due to my browser being
 IPv6-aware.
 People talk about publishers not turning on IPv6 for their domains,
 since there are misconfigured clients; I'd say IPv6 clients face a
 bigger problem, in the face of so many misconfigured servers.
 And fb.me is still down, BTW.

 Heh, finally someone must have noticed, and instead of fixing it for
 IPv6, they've just removed the AAAA record:

 Connected to fb.me.
 Escape character is '^]'.

 But it's still amusing that it's been down for so long.  I wonder how
 many hours (or possibly even days) it's been down for. :-)

 Wait, a site that's dedicated to sharing your life isn't privacy oriented?
 You don't say.

 Actually, my own reason for not joining facebook is that, back in the
 day, they seemed to have required a registration to use any portion of
 the site whatsoever, and I didn't want to impose such contagious and
 exclusive conditions onto the people I want to share my content with.
 Their privacy problems come from having been providing too much
 privacy to start with (for whichever reasons), and then gradually
 reducing said privacy (as market conditions and priorities or
 philosophies have changed).

 Not trying to rain on anyone's parade (honest!), but: could you guys
 move this over to outages-discussion ?  That list is better-suited for
 where this conversation is going.

Telus - Northern British Columbia - Prince George.
###############################################################
 Never thought I'd post here, but we have a gige via telus and get
 transit through it via Shaw.
 The circuit went down about noon PDT today and have not been able to
 get much info except for a master ticket number. There have been very
 little news coming out of Telus as this point.
 Does anyone have info about an outage affecting, from the sounds of it,
 a fairly significant outage for Telus in this part of the province.
 We do have a second gige with Telus directly and that has taken the traffic
 so I guess we have some diversity within telus for that one to remain up.
 Thanks,
 Keith

worldnic.com / Network Solutions DNS outage
###############################################################
 Clients with domains registered at Network Solutions are reporting their sites are inaccessible. The issue looks to be related to worldnic.com DNS services.
 http://dnscheck.pingdom.com/ shows the following errors:
 * Delegation not found at parent:
 	No delegation could be found at the parent, making your zone unreachable from the Internet
 * Not enough nameserver information was found to test the zone www.<domain>.com, but an IP address lookup succeeded in spite of that.
 The issue looks to be resolved now, but did anyone here notice similar issues?
 Thanks,

 I would not be surprised if this was some kind of Netsol maintenance
 that they just don't bother announcing.

 Nothing here all week either.
 Perhaps nobody is changing critical configurations due to the long holiday
 weekend ;)

 A list sub was an employee who left Qwest, and they set his address to
 bounce, using a bouncer that didn't say who he was.  All posters to the
 list got that direct bounce, so we were trying to clean it up, and now
 we have.

Chronic packet loss/latency in LAX (4 providers potentially involved)
###############################################################
 Hi folks,
 For the past 3-4 weeks (likely longer), there has been a peering point
 in Los Angeles that has been repeatedly overtaxed every night for
 roughly 5-6 hours.  Specifically high latency and packet loss.
 It tends to start at roughly the same time every day (1800 PDT), and
 tends to dissipate around the same time as well (2300 PDT or so) -- i.e.
 prime-time.  This is not ICMP prioritisation -- this is real packet loss
 (I can tell via SSH, fetching mail (IMAP), etc.).  However in recent
 days (past week or so), the issue has persisted even until hours as late
 as 0100 PDT, and today (for example) has existed since as early as 1500
 PDT.  So the situation as I said is getting worse.
 Because of asymmetrical routing, it's impossible for me to tell where
 peering-wise the actual issue is:
 a) between Comcast and GTT/nLayer
 b) between Comcast and Tata/AS6453
 c) between NTT/Verio and Tata/AS6453
 Of those 4 providers I've only a relationship with one; me getting all
 four to talk simultaneously, while the issue is happening, is virtually
 impossible.  However it happens every night like clockwork, for a long
 period of time, so resolution shouldn't be all that difficult.
 I do periodic mtrs (think traceroute + ping combined) between my home
 connection and my VPS.  Probe durations are 40 seconds, at intervals of
 60 seconds.  I store roughly 2-3 months of data, and I can make all this
 data available.
 Here's examples taken from tonight, both directions.  Source and
 destination IPs are provided.

 If relevant providers are on this list and can respond, that would
 be awesome.  If they can't respond but can instead start the ball
 rolling on rectifying this, I think myself and many other 'netizens
 would really appreciate it.

 Oh yes, I've been seeing this for some time, probably since mid-April.
 At times we've seen Comcast prepending their AS multiple times on 
 announcements through Level3, causing outbound to Comcast traffic 
 via congested routes with Tata, rather than what would otherwise be the 
 shorter, uncongested route via Level3. (Return traffic from Comcast in my 
 case returns via Level3.)
 For traffic from a server in San Francisco connected via Level3 and XO, 
 connecting to two Comcast cable modems in San Francisco, I see traffic go 
 out via XO, Tata, Comcast via LA, with what looks like major congestion, 
 then back up to SF.  With the appearance of major congestion on the 
 Tata<->Comcast link.
 I don't have any traffic which visiblity traverses NTT or nLayer, so I 
 couldn't say if the scope goes beyond the Tata-Comcast link.
 It's particularly annoying receiving LA latency + 5-6% packet loss going 
 to/from well connected locations a couple miles apart in SF. I'm 
 experiencing it now composing this message over ssh.
 Server in SF to Comcast in SF:

 The ComcastSF -> ServerInSF goes out via Level3 and sees no loss until 
 the final hop, suggesting the problem is with the reverse path, above. 
 (Most of the time, sometimes the first Comcast hops going out are very 
 congested too, though that's not usually the case).
 And here's two smokepings of the issue, in which you can clearly see the 
 timing of the issue you mentioned. SF server to SF cable modem, 2mi apart.
 http://cl.ly/image/040U3O2F0810 (last 30 hours)
 http://cl.ly/image/1D053a0T1k2I (last 10 days)
  <alpine.LRH.2.02.1305272109340.12602@leaf.lumiere.net>
 I don't think the issue is limited to just the providers listed.
 Over the last several days we have been getting reports of long load 
 times of sites hosted with us in Washington State. One specific customer 
 is Just north of SF and is a comcast customer. Here is a traceroute from 
 here before we worked with one of our upsteams today to route around 
 cogent and currently the traffic is going over level 3 and it is better. 
 I also had taken down that provider Last night for a while and Comcast 
 took the traffic up to Seattle to my other provider were it was handed 
 off. That link also worked very well. However Comcast to Cogent in 
 Southern CA seems to be having issues best I can tell.
 Sorry I don't think I have a MTR feed. I don't think any of my techs 
 saved one yet going from us back down to my customers location.
 Also i took out the beginning and ending of this for privacy. But the 
 bulk of the traceroute is here. I find the hope from 68.86.87.6 to 
 154.54.11.109 interesting in that is seems like there seems to be a good 
 jump in latency there.

 I hope this info is helpful. I have more data I can provide. Been trying 
 to work up some evidence on what is happening. And to try to pin point 
 the problem that is causing issues. It seems to be intermittent. But 
 like you said I think it does tend to be worse "Prime Time"

 This isn't surprising at all. Comcast is notorious for running their
 links into the ground.
 The Comcast<->TATA links have been congested for a while now. Some
 graphs from late 2010:

 Pretty sure they do this so content providers have no other choice but
 to pay them...

 Adding to the collective troubleshooting below (which mirrors my
 recent observations), I'd offer Tata being congested to various
 US-based peers as an additional "x factor".  That is to say, even if
 Tata-Comcast isn't congested in a given market, there is a possibility
 that Tata-[provider x] might be.

 A follow-up to this:
 I received *many* off-list mails about this, but nothing official.  Lots
 of (justified) speculation about which peering points and/or providers
 it is, to which I did respond to some, but nothing conclusive.
 Without going into details (respecting folks' privacy), I can say that
 the NTT/Verio<->Tata peering point has been ruled out as the cause.
 I should also note that the ingress path (Comcast-->ARP) has changed due
 to what appears to be some peering adjustments done by Comcast last
 night (specifically May 27th at 23:22 PDT or thereabouts).
 This will be obvious below in a pair of live mtrs done by me manually,
 with DNS resolution enabled.  (Someone off-list asked for this)
 My gut feeling right now is that the issue is at the Comcast<->Tata
 peering point (hops #5 and #6 in the 2nd mtr), or a Comcast router at
 One Wilshire is overwhelmed (hop #6 in the 2nd mtr).
 The reason I'm wanting to rule out ingress (Comcast->ARP) is because the
 path today looks different than it did yesterday (Comcast<->GTT/nLayer
 is no longer involved) yet the issue remains, thus something on the
 return path looks more likely.
 Anyway, here are the mtrs, taken about 10 minutes ago:

 Boy, what a day. So I just saw some strange routes die. I am connected to a time warner cable connection and I guess from my side I can't get around anything that is in the Chicago area.
 My route times out at 66.109.6.206 at ae-6-0.cr0.Chi30.tbone.rr.com And I can't even get to google.com Anyone else seeing this issue?

Earthlink/STS issues in Miami (again!)
###############################################################
 Earthlink/STS apparently had a VLX2020 fail last night in south Florida.
 No ETR, but have been told it's a major outage, and when I pressed for an
 ETR I was told they'd get back to me.
 I showed it went down last night around 20:15 Eastern Time, and it kind of
 came back up at 8:13 Eastern, but I've been told to expect it to bounce
 until it's resolved.
 Not sure if anyone else is affected by this, but figuring it's a VLX2020,
 I'm sure there are.  If anyone else who has been affected by this outage
 and the one on 5-6-13 can give me a jingle, let me know.  Trying to figure
 out if we can coordinate DR plans or something here.
 Thanks folks,

 The VLX2020 is White Rock gear (purchased by Turin who merged with Force10),
 and is End of Sale and I'm not sure if Turin is supporting it anymore.
 A neighboring network is migrating off of it now, as they've been plagued
 with issues over the years.

 Thanks.  By the time you checked it was already back up.  Outage time was
 about 35 to 40 minutes.
 A contact offline confirmed that ipv6.cablelabs.com was singlehomed (in
 terms of IPv6) to HE, so that explains the concurrence of events.  
 I suspect HE had an internal issue.

 Traceroutes show different things, but basically it's getting stuck
