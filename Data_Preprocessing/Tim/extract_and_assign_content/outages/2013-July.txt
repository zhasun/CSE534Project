Not sure if this is specific to att.net mail or a bigger issue but we've seen several of these:

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at yahoo.com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

Oh dear.

Forward me headers of a message that gave that error
privately, and I'll chase it down internally.

Thanks!

Subject: [outages] cannot resolve ca.gov from Linode default resolvers in
	Fremont
Message-ID: <51D22D6D.1000105@gmail.com>

Hello,

There seems to be an outage of ca.gov domain names from within Linode 
resolvers in Fremont.  I'm not sure what the issue is, because I cannot 
see there being anything wrong with ca.gov nameservers; nonetheless, the 
names cannot be resolved through Linode's default resolver.

It has been more than an hour already as ca.gov cannot be accessed with 
Linode's default resolvers.

Cheers,
Constantine.

Not the right tests. What you should do:

1) dig to the Linode resolvers. If the resolver is 2001:db8:1::53,
then :

dig @2001:db8:1::53 A ns5.net.ca.gov

then the same with +cd (I don't know if Linode resolvers validate with
DNSSEC)

2) dig to the authoritative resolvers to see if it is a network
problem. Their addresses are 205.225.182.2, 134.186.254.247 and
205.225.182.66. So:

dig @205.225.182.2 SOA ca.gov

By the way, there IS something wrong in net.ca.gov. Name resolution of
the nameservers' names servfails. To quote DNSviz "DNSKEYs exist for
algorithm(s) 8, 7 in the net.ca.gov zone, but the net.ca.gov/SOA RRset
was not signed by any DNSKEY with algorithm(s) 7."

It works for me under the guest account and my login. 
I know they've recently had some scheduled maintenance.

Down for me via Cogent since 8:40 am Central.  IPv4 access is just fine.
IPv6 access from another host via NTT is fine, too, so I suspect a Cogent
issue.

Sorry for the noise, it was confirmed to be a not-yet-fully understood issue
between our upstream provider and one of their providers.  Traceroutes now
show it flowing over Sprint.

Down for me via Cogent since 8:40 am Central.  IPv4 access is just fine.
IPv6 access from another host via NTT is fine, too, so I suspect a Cogent
issue.

We are seeing major issues with them, here is the update from their NOC:


We are looking at this issue and it appears there is an issue out in Zayo
Bandwidth causing degraded intermittent packet loss.  This issue has been
escalated to the highest level within Zayo Bandwidth and Onvoy.  Once there
is something found, we will be sure to pass it along.  Currently they are
trying to isolate where the issue could possibly be.

Zayo Bandwidth is currently working with their equipment vendor to try and
Isolate this issue.

Zayo Bandwidth has a tech on site and they are in the process of either
rebooting or reseating a piece of equipment.  Again there is still no ETR.
Once we have something more we will pass it along.

I've been using HTTP anywhere (in Firefox), and whatever does that in Chrome,
on both Linux and Windows, for some months or more.

Suddenly tonight, I see that Chrome is complaining about mixed-mode security
on Twitter -- but not on FB or any other sites I visit that way.

Firefox isn't complaining about Twitter.

Chrome is known to be pickier about this; a site I worked on had to test
both cause Chrome would complain when FF did not.

Can some other folks check Twitter over HTTPS/IPv4 tonight and see if they
are also getting the slashed-out https indication on Twitter?

Cheers,

I use Twitter via IPv4 (and exclusively the HTTPS scheme), and use
Firefox, quite regularly (20-30 times a day).

I know exactly what you mean when you say "mixed-mode security" (for
readers: accessing a site using HTTPS, but the URLs referenced within
that site (for things like CSS, images, etc.) might use HTTP).

But what I don't know is where you've seen this.  As in a step-by-step
for where you commonly see it.  Even if it varies, just make an itemised
list of steps (from the point you hit http://twitter.com/ to wherever
you see the issue) where you commonly see it.

I can try to reproduce it there if need be, and/or do some analysis with
either Firebug's Network tab or Wireshark, but I need a good starting
point!  :-)

Also, and I probably don't need to tell you this, but too much code on
webservers (doesn't matter where (front or back-end)) behaves different
based on HTTP User-Agent string.  (I could write my own rant about this
completely unnecessary approach, but I'll spare folks)

Generally, anywhere I go on twitter's site (since it's AJAX now, there
really isn't anywhere you "go"), it's https and it's not crossed out,
as Chrome does to indicate mixed-mode.

As of tonight, I'm getting the "crossed-out https" indicator everywhere,
even after a cache purge and a Ctrl-F5 reload.

Remind me where Chrome identifies what's unsecure, and I'll go look it up.

Sure.  But this is "change in working environment, not apparently prompted
by anything user-side".

This explains the meaning of the crossed-out https indicator:

Javascript Console.  That should give you an error where things went wrong,
and tell you specifically what it's unhappy about.

Interesting.  From Jay's description (and my lack of familiarity with
Chrome), I assumed what he was describing was what the above doc
classified as the "warning" indicator ("The site uses SSL but Chrome has
detected insecure content on the page").

The "crossed-out https" thing is defined vaguely/ambiguously (how
convenient), but looks to be focused on either expired or incorrectly
configured certs, or "mysteriously malevolent stuff".  The latter made
me laugh because, hey, let's not be specific at all, nobody needs to
know.....

I've taken a look at the certs I get back (there's 3 involved;
Verisign's primary CA, Verisign's extended validation CA, and the one
for twitter.com) and I don't really see anything wrong with any of them.
I verified the CN/CommonName looks correct (twitter.com), and that the
validity range (e.g. expiry, before/after) are legit.

I can dump them if need be, just let me know.

We're seeing widespread issues getting SMS messages back and forth between various North American carriers. Informal testing between at&t and Verizon is failing, and we're seeing high fail rates delivering SMS in a number of contexts.

One indication of problems from an SMS service: http://status.twilio.com/services/outgoing-sms

Anyone else see anything or know what's up?

Some evidence: I'm on Sprint (in Seattle), ported through Google
Voice, and GV is not seeing them, so my friends aren't either! However
I did receive some this morning from a friend on AT&T.

Our NOC is also noting extended SMS delivery times for both ingress and
egress, confirmed in recent testing as of a few moments ago (VZW<->ATT &
ATT<>VZW).

We are still in the process of testing other carriers now.

Initial observations point to an issue at Syniverse, however we are still
in the process of confirming such.

If interested - we can keep you posted off-list as updates seem to be
coming in every few minutes.

This seems to be PRIMARILY between ATT and VZW.

 

I have been able to duplicate the symptoms between those carriers in several
different BTA's on both coasts. There seems to be some minor Sprint
involvement but the bulk is ATT-> VZW and VZW-> ATT

 

ATT-> ATT and VZW -> VZW seems unaffected

 

 

NOTE: My systems (approximately 300 nationwide) are all MO/MT based using
cellular modems

I've been doing unrelated testing of SMS between AT&T and T-Mobile today
without any issues.

Is everyone that is having issues in one region? or spread across the
country?  I am on sprint and don't appear to be having issues.

I'm ruling this on topic; if you can give us a roll up every half hour or so 
as you know new stuff that'd be great.

It was widespread in North America; it has since resolved for me, but we noticed about an hour of impact (4-5 minute delays or worse) when crossing carriers.

"binding" refers to the SMPP binds (TCP connections) that connect the
aggregator (Syniverse) to the customer (AT&T/T-Mobile/Verizon/Sprint or
other large aggregators such as Iris or SAP/Sybase). These TCP connections
are the ones that transfer all the messages. Usually there are hundreds per
large carrier.

Does this traffic run across the public Internet (either raw or VPNned), or is it WAN traffic?

Without getting into too much detail or violating any existing NDA's
currently in place - we can say that all traffic is either encrypted via
(VPN/IPSEC/Public Internet) or for heavier users they can opt for
unencrypted private line ethernet transport, at the expense of the customer.

While a little older, here's a couple of documents that may help describe
the overall "connectivity model" Syniverse and other SMS participants
currently use:

A customer has seen a power glitch and a cooling problem in a suite on the 4th floor at 151 Front.  At this time the devices are reporting falling sensor temperatures so cooling might be working now.

Another service provider has reported that their connections to Chicago and Halifax are affected by power outages and/or flooding due to heavy rain seen this afternoon in southern Ontario.

CP24 reports that there is "another cluster of thunderstorms" on the way.

We took a brief hit on AC power in 602 (Cologix) but not on DC power.
Temperatures rose rapidly but are now starting to cool slowly (chilled water
running at 50% required output I've heard).

Massive flooding in various parts of Toronto according to news coverage?.

Seeing lots of reports of people unable to get to many Google services.
 Seems to be affecting Comcast users disproportionately.  It's fine for me,
but a lot of my staff are basically out of luck...but according to the
Google Apps Status page, everything is fine.

It's anecdotal, but it would seem like there's an issue based on these
reports.

Oh, and this:
http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/10/tech/web/google-down/index.html

Anyone know what's up?  Fiber cut?  DC outages?

Massive issues with a number of major sites, appears to be related to the
google outage (as in unable to reach google analytics and as such the
browser stalls, appearing as if the site the end user is attempting to
reach is inaccessible).

And yes, we can confirm an intermittent google outage across most major
platforms in the southeast, except verizon wireless.

I'm seeing browser stalls / hangs while trying to access
ajax.googleapis.com on various websites.


It looks as if google has succeeded in placing a single point of
failure into a significant number of websites.

Sprint is having a cell phone outage affecting the entire east coast,
any phone which was EVER on the Nextel network, even if subsequently moved
to Sprint years ago, calls not going through. 
ETTR 1pm CST.

Apparently Sprint shut down the servers which controlled the Nextel network,

after shutting down the Nextel network itself two weeks ago, 
not taking into consideration that turning off those Nextel servers would
break the ability to use many Sprint phones.

FYI - got a call from a customer last night about a Xerox site unreachable
through us.  Found the prefix coming from Cymru.  Instructed our NOC to
work with them to resolve.  Cymru first claimed they were not sending it
because it was not a bogon.  Once we proved it was coming from them, they
woke somebody up at our request and found it listed as a 'bad route',
whatever that means.  Their workaround was to shut down the peering to us.

Anybody else use Cymru and have this issue?  Our 2 peering addresses
are 38.229.66.20 and 193.231.140.82

Thanks.

All,

Sprint has been advertising for sometime that they are going to shutdown the nextel network. I do not know if this is related to that.

Hello Outages list!

We have identified a hardware problem associated with the full bogons
peering sessions that were taken offline roughly 12 hours ago. The
service has been disabled and at this time we do not have an ETA on when
service will be restored.

We will issue updates at approximately 8am, 12pm, and 5pm EST until
this outage is resolved.

For the finer details please read below.

8pm EST 7/15/13, Team Cymru was notified of a couple problems with our
Bogon service. At this time we did not know the severity and scope of
the larger problem.

11pm EST 7/15/13 the issue was escalated from Operations to Engineering.

1am EST 7/16/13, we confirmed the propagation of incorrect prefixes.
Workarounds failed to fully mitigate the issue, so all sessions were
disabled. This ceased the propagation of incorrect prefixes.

~2am EST 7/16/13, we sent out notices to everyone we have current
contact details on regarding the outage.

12:15pm EST 7/16/13, we are working on replacing / reconfiguring
hardware to resolve this outage.

On behalf of Team Cymru, I would like to apologize for this outage. we
are actively working on getting the Bogons back online for distribution.

In the interim, we are having listing updates periodically, it is
located here:

https://www.team-cymru.org/Services/Bogons/

For those who are using our service, thank you! Be assured we are
working towards resolution.

Sincerely,

Don Napier

Team CYMRU is having issues with their BGP Bogon Service.

Below is an email I received from them a little bit ago.



To all,



We have identified a hardware problem associated with the fullbogons peering sessions that were taken offline roughly 12 hours ago.  The service has been disabled and at this time we do not have an ETA on when service will be restored.



We will issue updates at approximately 8am, 12pm, and 5pm EST until this outage is resolved.

FYI - got a call from a customer last night about a Xerox site unreachable through us.  Found the prefix coming from Cymru.  Instructed our NOC to work with them to resolve.  Cymru first claimed they were not sending it because it was not a bogon.  Once we proved it was coming from them, they woke somebody up at our request and found it listed as a 'bad route', whatever that means.  Their workaround was to shut down the peering to us.

Anybody else use Cymru and have this issue?  Our 2 peering addresses are 38.229.66.20 and 193.231.140.82

Thanks.

Hello Outages,

Service was restored tonight at about EST 530PM 7/16/13.  We replaced
the faulty hardware (a router in this case) at our data center.  The
Bogon feeds should be flowing properly now.

In the future, status of the Bogon Reference Project will be listed at:

https://www.team-cymru.org/Services/Bogons/index.html

Thanks you for your patience,

Hello all, has anyone else noticed that some of the Network Solutions name
servers are unresponsive? Take this for example:

AMERIGON.COM has name server entries NS9.WORLDNIC.COM and
NS10.WORLDNIC.COM...

$ dig @ns9.worldnic.com amerigon.com

; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> @ns9.worldnic.com amerigon.com
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

$ dig @ns10.worldnic.com amerigon.com

; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> @ns10.worldnic.com amerigon.com
; (1 server found)

Now more of our sites are starting to fail as the local DNS cache begins to
expire. This could be affecting everyone who uses NetSol for name
resolution, or at least a large cross-section of their user base.

Yup, just noticed this for a few sites (groceryiq.com is one of them); the 
ones I'm seeing use ns43.worldnic.com/ns44.worldnic.com.

Can confirm this from my Comcast residential connection in Mountain
View, CA.  Other types of queries (NS, SOA, etc.) result in the same
behaviour.

Also just for the record:

ns9.worldnic.com has address 205.178.190.5
ns10.worldnic.com has address 206.188.198.5

traceroutes/mtrs to these destinations stop presumably at a border
router -- this will vary based on source location, but for me trying to
reach ns9 stops at hr1-tengig-2-0-0.sterling2dc2.savvis.net, ns10 stops
at ae-1-51.edge4.Atlanta2.Level3.net.  So possibilities include issues
with NetSol, or return path issues (which I obviously cannot confirm).

Hello all, has anyone else noticed that some of the Network Solutions name servers are unresponsive? Take this for example:
AMERIGON.COM<http://AMERIGON.COM> has name server entries NS9.WORLDNIC.COM<http://NS9.WORLDNIC.COM> and NS10.WORLDNIC.COM...

NetSol name servers are unreachable here as well, and we're also seeing failures.

Now more of our sites are starting to fail as the local DNS cache begins to expire. This could be affecting everyone who uses NetSol for name resolution, or at least a large cross-section of their user base.

Dig ns72.worldnic.com at ns71.worldnic.com (205.178.190.36) ...

07/17/13 09:54:28 dig ns72.worldnic.com @ ns72.worldnic.com
Dig ns72.worldnic.com at ns72.worldnic.com (206.188.198.36) ...
Non-authoritative answer
Nameserver has a problem and can't talk right now

Netsol website is very slow but makes no mention of any problems. trying 
to open a ticket, but I'm sure they know...

We're seeing the same thing here, plus the NetSol website appears down.  Appears to be across multiple NS servers and not just 43/44.

We have seen it across many Network Solutions DNS servers clients are using.

Specifically:

ns10 and ns11
ns31 and ns32
ns53 and ns54
ns97 and ns98

I think there have been a few more, checking with staff, so wider spread than just a couple of their dns servers.

According to Twitter, you are right :-)

A bit better now:

% check-soa -i AMERIGON.COM     
ns10.worldnic.COM.
	206.188.198.5: OK: 112080413 (137 ms)
ns9.worldnic.COM.

The Web site http://www.networksolutions.com/ seems down as well.

Now posted on their facebook site: ?Network Solutions is experiencing a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack that is impacting our customers as well as the Network Solutions site. Our technology team is working to mitigate the situation. Please check back for updates.?  I don?t have their earlier posting talking about yesterday?s issues.

 

I also learned from a co-worker (who supports some small banks) about yesterday?s issues that ?It was an Islamic group.  It sounded like servers were compromised, which lead to the compromised web sites.?  He either learned this in a news article, or a banking-related security bulletin.

Yes the site is down and some of the World NIC DNS servers

Now more of our sites are starting to fail as the local DNS cache begins to expire. This could be affecting everyone who uses NetSol for name resolution, or at least a large cross-section of their user base.

Author of that blog post is reiterating what was said on June 20th
(almost a month ago), implying it's happening again today yet there's
no actual evidence of that.

No, no, no. This paper is, despite its date, about a month-old *other*
problem, documented in
<http://blogs.cisco.com/security/hijacking-of-dns-records-from-network-solutions/>. Bad
copy. As usual, do not believe eveything you read on the Web.

Hmm, we have been having issues for the last 2 hours, took a while to point the issue towards cogent, and 5 minutes after I sent this email, the problem disappeared...

I'm seeing 30% loss and high latency across a DC-area hop of theirs to Verizon FIOS. This is a routine problem lately but this morning is especially bad.

Subject: [outages] SE Michigan: AT&T cell (3G and data) service downtime
 evening of July 19, 2013
Message-ID: <CAPRZce0kX_Y1O6KVwsMgZwRa=Ew7iA0cwjt=9O9MP2C8ZkL03A@mail.gmail.com>

Multiple reports on Twitter suggest problems with the AT&T cell service (3G
and data) across SE Michigan (Ann Arbor, Warren, Grand Blanc all reported
in). The outage lasted about an hour (about 9p -10p ET) according to
reports and service appears to be normal now.

I don't have any inside info.

Subject: [outages] EC2 Singapore Unreachable?
Message-ID: <CALy4ZmTiSzfCNor0S4YHXDX3E9+G7y3B+nq4srxEFH0=cPshuA@mail.gmail.com>

Unfortunately, since AWS doesn't supply a console to EC2 Linux VMs, I can't
get a traceroute back to the US. I am currently unable to reach any of my 6
instances in availability zone ap-southeast-1. All of the routes seem to
die at ec2-175-41-128-XXX.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com.

Public DNS/IP of one of the EC2 instances:
ec2-54-251-238-185.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com 54.251.238.185

mtr output from 3 locations is attached.

Subject: [outages] Comcast/Cogent Peering issue at 56 Marietta
Message-ID: <CAPC+kK6aW+F-3d8Oyu0BDH47HFB5Sx8d2QspOHYVf3b8a0zfsw@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone else seeing packet loss starting at the peering point for Comcast
and Cogent at 56 Marietta Ga? Had someone mention it on IRC about seeing
issues from Comcast customers. I ran a few MTR's to some of our customers
and found one site in the Atlanta area that I could reproduce the issue.
Others in the metro area were fine if they bypassed that data center/peers.
like xo to Comcast was fine. On this location I don't have an actual device
to do a reverse path on.

MTR from my VPS in Buffalo(75.127.15.150) to 75.147.194.94 in Lithia
Springs, GA 30122

Yes, it's congested, and (judging from duration, and public statements
from both sides) unlikely to get upgraded...

Update I received from AT&T:

Massive outage in ohio. Not expected to be back up until 2:30 CST.

Message-ID: <CAPC+kK5Vh-RUbebgncP14FC7q8JrS1TrXpErCZxKde6-QMbEvg@mail.gmail.com>

Is anyone else seeing a DSL outage(sync no surf) for the past few days? We
have 2 DSL lines that have been down for 3days 4 hours at this point. ATT
keeps pushing the ETR back. Now they are telling us the ETR is 7/24/13 at
4pm. Does anyone have any "inside" information of whats going on? We have 2
dry loops that have sync but we can't authenticate. ATT did their normal
song and dance of saying no outage for the first day and we had to dispatch
a tech to find out the outage.

Location is Bay City, MI

Ticket # I provided for the outage is 2677-12440

Yes, I'm seeing this also from Peak10 and Colo5 in Jacksonville,
particularly with reverse-DNS lookups.  Queries from both sites are
reaching Google via Time Warner, as4323.

Message-ID: <31178659.1946.1374634199333.JavaMail.root@benjamin.baylink.com>

I use XMPP and Pidgin to connect to FB chat, and tonight, for the 
first time in my memory, some of my active users in the user list 
are showing up (both in the list and in conversation panes) with 
no "Real Name" alias; just -biglongdecimalnumber at chat.facebook.com.

There doesn't seem to be any pattern; most users who are active show
up as usual.

It's flapped in and out several times; first spotted around 2233EDT.

If anyone has a channel to Facebook Chat engineering, you might pass
this along.

Cheers,

Well, my sister is on Mindspring/Earthlink rather than Road Runner, 
but she's one hop past ten0-0-0-4.tamp09-ser2.bhn.net, and tracing to her
modem from my VPS in Texas, I bet 0.0% loss and no appreciable jump in
28ish ms times, so, "can you provide some more detail"? :-)

Wish I could, I won't have more info until tomorrow was just looking to see
if anything was for sure known as we had 4 or 5 customers not able to get
to us but I didn't get confirmation of this until I was already on the way
out, haven't got any MTRs back yet to see where it's failing.

Hi -

I apologize for the delay in getting wiki up/running in a timely manner. 
At this time wiki.outages.org is up and functioning as expected. The 
disk space had filled completely causing mysql to crash. We had to purge 
old apache logs to get enough space to start MySQL safely.

As of right now, there is 160+ gigs of spam entries from past year but 
from our maintenance in January, we do not see that additional spam has 
been posted.

We will need to go through another round of maintenance so we can 
proceed with spam removal.

More as it develops.

Peering was just restored.  Apparently there was a facilities issue over
the weekend.  The problem was compounded by staff that no longer works
there and a failed phone system.  Thanks to all who responded with
information and ideas on how to troubleshoot.
