SAN FRANCISCO, July 24 (Reuters) - Sporadic power outages hit San
Francisco on Tuesday afternoon, affecting widespread areas including
the city's downtown financial district.

About 28,000 customers in San Francisco and an area south of the city
were affected, said Darlene Chiu, spokeswoman for Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., the main utility for the city. More than 20,000 of those
outages were in San Francisco, she said.

"We are investigating the cause of it," said Chiu, adding that the
utility is having on-and-off success in reconnecting customers by
backup circuits.

Traffic signals in much of downtown San Francisco were not working.
Bay Area Rapid Transit trains were moving, although some of the lights
in undergound stations were off, a BART spokesman told local radio.

The outages began about 2 p.m. PDT, Chiu said.

The utility is owned by PG&E Corp.

Heh,

They have pretty anal security people there, so I tend to disbelieve,
but I guess anything is possible.

We lost power to all circuits in one of the colo-rooms there, but not
another, so it may just be more issues with their power distribution gear.

They dropped us and a bunch of other customers for several hours in a
different colo-room last year when a circuit breaker failed.

Poor excuse. Aren't they supposed to have generators/batteries? Does 
anybody seriously accept "power outages" as an excuse your servers went 
offline? I wouldn't. What are you actually paying them for if you do?

Quoted:

	"It was reported there were several brief outages in a row before
the power went out for good, so I bet the CPS (flywheel) systems weren't
fully back up to speed when the next sequential outage occurred. Since
several of these grid power interruption happened in a row, and were shorter
than the time required to trigger generator startup, the generators were not
automatically started, BUT the CPS didn't have time to get back up to full
capacity. By the 6th power glitch, there wasn't enough energy stored in the
flywheels to keep the system going long enough for the diesel generators to
start up and come to speed before switching over."

Ladies and Gentlemen, this is why you must program your power control
systems and/or auto transfer switches to be committed to transfer, even if
utility returns. This is almost ATS 101.

This same situation can occur in typical UPS systems -- several small hits
can cause a significant drain on batteries, but return quick enough to not
transfer a to-generator event.

You should:

	a) ensure a generator start, no matter how short the outage duration
	b) commit a transfer to generator even if utility has returned
	c) stay on generator for a minimum of (some period of time) -- 15
minutes, imho.

My rack in Colo 7 lost power for 2 minutes. I heard someone else say  
that they didn't lose power at all in Colo 7.

Colo 4 supposedly lost power.

Colo 1 lost power for 20 minutes according to this message.

Colo 2, 3, 5, 6, 8  - any reports?

Hmm, make that not in colo 6. 365 Main says:

As a result of the incident, continuous power was interrupted for up to 45
mins for certain customers.  We're certain colo rooms 1, 3 and 4 were
directly affected, though other colocation rooms are still being
investigated.  We are currently working with Hitec, Valley Power Systems,
Cupertino Electric and PG&E to further investigate the incident and
determine the root cause.

Cheers,
-Allen

My Gig-E Cogent link (Tyco Rd, Vienna Virginia) seems to be fine now.  
There was scheduled maintenance 3:00 AM - 7:00 AM, followed by a lot  
of ~ 5 second drops of packet transit. Haven't had any issues since ~  
9:00 AM EDT.

Regards
Marshall
