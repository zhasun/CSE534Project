Anyone else seeing issues with Optimum Lightpath service in southern CT 
(Greenwich) or the NYC area?   We lost a 10 meg circuit about 30 minutes 
ago.

Sprint's 4g service is still working out here in the burbs of Chicago.
Sounds like a tower outtage.

Hi -

We had to shutdown our peering with level3 in san diego. We are told 
level3 had a router failure or some sort of corruption. Waiting for RFO.

Did anyone notice this outage?

I suspect a CDN problem of some sort, but I don't think Facebook, much less fbcdn.net, has a status page.  :-)

I've just updated the Dashboard and refactored everything that isn't actual
links to status pages off to other places, BTW, at wiki.outages.org.

So if you haven't been by in a while, check it out.

And ignore the spam; I'll be working on that tomorrow.

Vi: drop me a note and remind me of the server login?  Lost my mail archive.

Yeah, definitely wasn't a phantom. If anyone ends up with a master ticket that would be nice to know about.

Nothing on the portal, but the detail to 4622732 - Fiber Damage due to inclement weather/ice is an interesting read. Glad I am not a Level 3 field tech, I hate cold weather.

I am not sure that the release of specific Portal information from a vendor is appropriate, or not a violation of the AUP.

The public information is that a fiber conduit that travels near or under water between Tulsa and Barnsdale OK is being crushed by ice, and degrading the optical characteristics of the fiber. Besides affecting the vendor's circuits, several major circuits that make up part of the Research and Education network backbones are also affected. The internal notes indicate that there are other customers affected. Time of day and temperature are affecting the magnitude of disruptions.

The problem goes back to the 8th of Feb. I can only imagine the work being done to try and thaw out and dry out the path, given the weather conditions. It is currently 35, with an expected low tonight around 18.

Hi -

Does anyone have any insight into anything that may be causing issues 
across the transatlantic connection to US, Varna (Bulgaria) and Odesa 
(Ukraine) region to be specific. We have users complaining about 
intermittent loss of connectivity and poor latency. This is going on for 
the past few hours.

Any insight will be greatly appreciated.

I cannot speak about specific customers, but our traffic to Algeria is very slightly less than it was 24 hours ago.  Fri -> Sat variation most likely).

Yes, it is actually on par with or higher than it was 7 days ago.

The country is still up, at least for now.

Good(?) morning all,

FYI, for around the past two hours Cogent's Herndon VA datacenter has
been entirely offline, they are reporting power + generator issues with
no ETR, and no ticket number, as their ticketing systems are affected by
the outage as well.  Always a good way to start the morning!

Yeah, thanks Frank, power was restored around 9:00-9:15am ET to Cogent's
networking gear, and it seems they started bringing customer power back
around 10:00 ET or a little before then.  Fun times!

Our office connection is up and down.  Status page says:

At this time customers in Chicago may be experiencing routing issues or
loss of connectivity. Our Network Operations team is investigating and a
Field Engineer is en route to the site with an ETA of 30 minutes. Our
ticket for this issue is 2299987.

(Of course, there's no indication of when that ETA is from).

The Cogent toll-free number's status message with that same update is
timestamped 2:50pm ET, so I'd assume 30 minutes from then (or from some
time before then).  Cogent's not having a very good day. :)

I noticed a bit of a blip in connectivity with some gear we have at their
427 S La Salle POP about 20 minutes ago, but connectivity appears solid (at
the moment at least).

My Speakeasy/Megapath VoIP just went out.  They're having an outage in 
all of Southern California.  Is "Phonebooth" a reseller of Megapath?

They aren't, and Phonebooth cust. care is going to a voice mailbox, although
the @Phonebooth twitter account is mentioning the issue now.

Hi everyone...

We appear to be having power problems in the Westin Blgd in Seattle and have heard reports of other colo providers having power issues which implies it is a greater building power issue.

Is anyone else having power issues in the Westin?

Not exactly a surprise.  They've been having massive capacity propblems both east and west out of the sub-continent for a while now.  They're flailing to reroute and tune LSPs around it.

You can observe some of this at my leak detector script/system

http://puck.nether.net/bgp/leakinfo.cgi

it appears they are leaking level3 routes to a number of peers.

I'm can't reach any of my Comcast VPN sites on my XO gig connection in Minneapolis.  All Comcast-bound traffic appears to be dropped at the Minneapolis core for me.  We called XO, and they acknowledged the problem, but have no cause, master ticket, or repair estimate as of 2:30 Central time.

I'm dropping traffic to 173.160.0.0/13 (Comcast) through XO, but not through my other providers. In fact, I'm not even seeing the route via XO. Anybody else having similar issues?

I meant 6453, the old Teleglobe backbone.  Not Tata in India, as4775.

You can see this by noticing the 2892 entries in Jared's page for 6453 vs. 0 for 4775.  That's probably triple-counting the number of lines, but "leaking" O(1000) prefixes is pretty bad.

We're seeing extremely high packet loss to Comcast from Level3 and NTT.
Level3 is currently tearing down their BGP peering with TATA.  Their
master ticket #4652453
NTT is letting TATA figure it out, but that's not helping us any..

Cheers
