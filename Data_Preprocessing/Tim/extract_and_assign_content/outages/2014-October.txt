While on my Hurricane Electric IPv6 tunnel, I cannot access
juniper.net unless I change my local interface MTU.  1500 fails, but
1280 works.  I noticed this a few days ago.  Before that I had no
problems with a 1500 MTU.  Is anyone else seeing this issue?

No, but if your are using a 6in4 tunnel, the MTU should be 1480 (not 1500).

(I just successfully went to www.juniper.net via IPv6 with that MTU 1480.)

My tunnel router has a 1280 MTU on the henet interface:

6in4-henet Link encap:IPv6-in-IPv4  
          inet6 addr: 2001:470:xxxx:xxxx::2/64 Scope:Global
          inet6 addr: fe80::xxxx:xxxx/128 Scope:Link
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP  MTU:1280  Metric:1
          RX packets:17148418 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:12347808 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
          RX bytes:2660258163 (2.4 GiB)  TX bytes:2833651623 (2.6 GiB)

But the LAN interface of that router has an MTU of 1500, as does my
desktop system.  I believe the issue is that the juniper.net web
server has an MTU of 1500 and their network or somewhere along the
path is blocking ICMP Packet Too Big messages that would be sent by
the HE.net tunnel router.

Like I said, I changed nothing on my end, and it was working before.
I don't know if juniper.net just added IPv6 to their website, or if
something else changed in the path.

It's nearly a requirement to lower your MTU / enable mss-clamping when
doing ipv6 tunnels. It's possible some connectivity of yours was broken
and you just didn't notice it until now. I had to do this on my J series
and I also have to do it on my OpenBSD firewall -- 

# mss clamping down to 1280. 1220 + 60 for ipv6 header
match on egress all scrub (random-id no-df max-mss 1220)

The whole fragmentation situation with IPv6 is kind of a joke

I know.  But I'm reporting this here on outages in the hopes that a
responsible party would see it and can fix the root cause of this
particular issue.  E.g. stop dropping ICMP Packet Too Big.

Interesting.  Does the 1480 MTU setting from RA show up on your
interface configuration, or in a routing table entry?  Is your TCP
connection to www.juniper.net using an MSS of 1220?  If so, then of
course you wouldn't see the issue.

I'm using OpenWRT for the HE.net tunnel.  I'll have to see how to send
the MTU in the LAN RA.

For me, www.juniper.net is on Akamai, so you might try there.  You might
also see what happens with other Akamized IPv6 sites.

Actually this is the wrong way to go about it.  It's hiding the symptoms
instead of fixing the problem.

This is not about fragmentation.  (Indeed, the whole story about IPv6 frag
handling in *BSD firewalls is too sad to think about it)

The MTU of your tunnel is lower than 1500.

Chances are the service on the other end isn't able to recieve pmtud
messages because it's load-balanced... and the first packet that
triggers that (ptb) is sent towards your tunnel ingress.

Welcome to the wonders of IPv6, where fragmentation in the network
isn't possible.

It's better this way, trust us...

Chances are the first large packet is from the server end, not my
client end.  So if www.juniper.net sends a 1500-byte packet, it should
arrive at the HE.net tunnel router and that router should send a PTB
back to the server.  Are you saying the PTB might not be received by
the server because it is behind a load-balancer?  Shouldn't the
load-balancer handle the PTB directly in that case since it terminates
the TCP connection?

This problem can be solved by setting the tcp-mss under internet-options on the juniper.

I used 1280, but there may be a larger more optimal value.

Actually, given the nature of browsers these days, it is not at all unlikely that your request to the Juniper web server contains 1280+ octets of HTTP header data and thus is the largest packet. I think if you investigate further you will find that most flows stall at the point of a TCP packet larger than N octets payload hitting the Juniper from the LAN side and being small enough that it doesn't generate a PTB message, so it gets silently dropped.

At least that's what happened in my environment before I reduced the tcp-mss as described in my earlier message.

And to Warren, yes, not fragmenting in the network _IS_ actually better.

The Linux "/sbin/ip" command apparently can show mtu and advmss (as
seen in Google search results), but on my system it doesn't show them.
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<interface>/mtu does show it though.

Given the lack of "advmss" output in "/sbin/ip -6 route show", I'm
using tcpdump to verify the initial SYN packet.

I did just set this on my OpenWrt router.  I see from "rdisc6" (and
tcpdump) that I'm now getting a Link MTU option.  But "/sbin/ip" still
doesn't show it anywhere.  /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<interface>/mtu is
showing the change to 1480.

Right.  If you turn off the AdvLinkMTU option (or set it back to 1500)
such that the initial SYN sets an MSS of 1440, do you then have
problems reaching www.juniper.net?

if it's not generating a ptb on the tunnel ingress it's kinda broken.

yes ssl server for example is a good way to stimulate that.

or behind a layer-3 ecmp hash in which case it may not be getting back
to the machine which has the layer 3 flow terminated.

if the right device receives it then yes.

Ditto mine (proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<interface>/mtu is 1480). ip does not 
cough up MTU.

No, which is a bit puzzling. WIth MTU at 1500 on LAN interface, TCP 
connect had outbound SYN with MSS 1420, return SYN ACK with MSS 1420. No 
related ICMPv6 seen. This was tried from a LAN device, not the edge 
router (i.e., the one with the tunnel).

I /think/ you may have to flush your routing table after changing
MTU--it seems the route cache maintains the per-destination MTU/MSS.
At one point I saw some extra routes with MTU 1280 in "/sbin/ip -6
route show".

Forgot to mention location. I'm trying from Canada. It also might just be a
SPDY problem. Trying curl seems to be okay. It also has been flaky, works 1
out of every 10 refreshes.

Subject: [outages] IPv6 routing loop in GTT ?
Message-ID: <1412686505.712930.176100089.283F5C3E@webmail.messagingengine.com>

I am using Charter's 6rd IPv6 tunnel at home and noticed within the last
few days I can't get to/from my Digital Ocean VM via IPv6. From both
Digital Ocean and Charter 6rd tunnel I can get to Google, Facebook, etc
via IPv6 but not to each other.

It appears there are routing issues in GTT as it hits 64 hops and gives
up. I haven't found more examples.

Subject: [outages] Belkin [heartbeat.belkin.com]
Message-ID: <20141007151716.GA23217@corky>

On one of my netblocks my subscribers can nolonger ping Belkin.  I can ping
heartbeat.belkin.com from my webservers and from subscriber units on a
different netblock.

Apparently Belkin routers ping the home base every couple seconds to determine
the correct color of the Internet light on the router (orange or blue *sigh*).
Worse, when it can't ping the Belkin site the router seems to pack up and
redirect my subscribers to their router configuration page.

I found this pretty easy to work around.  I simply DNATed the pings intended
for heartbeat.belkin.com to one of my local nameservers and that seems to get
them back online.  It's a silly workaround, but if anyone else is seeing all
the Belkin routers on their network pack up, this could be why.

Funny,

Just saw something about Belkin routers and a botched firmware upgrade.

I wonder if this is what they meant.

That being said, it is working fine from Zito Media in Clanton, AL.

Just because you can ping it does not mean it will work.  I've confirmed
with other users this is the case.  I believe there is some sort of HTTP
request that confirms the connection is working (like Windows, Android,
etc).

Another resolution is to just loopback 67.20.176.130 (seems to be this IP
for everyone so far).

Where?  I keep reading "bad firmware" problems but everything suggests
there is no automatic upgrade and I think we can safely assume resi users
didn't upgrade their routers over night.

And I am thinking the same thing you are. Doubt resi users upgraded 
their router overnight.

Like you said, chances are it has to do with that heartbeat. Asked a few 
folks around the US to ping it, some successful, some not, and they 
weren't behind anything Belkin related.

Please provide more information on this ? our helpdesk is getting calls about this.  Are you saying just route 67.20.176.130 to a pingable IP?

I believe it needs to both be pingable and attempt an HTTP request.  If the
HTTP request fails and ping works, the router just assumes the Internet is
working.

If it can't ping it, it assumes the "Internet is down".

I don't have any Belkin routers on hand so I can't confirm this theory.

I think it was initially suspected to be a firmware upgrade, but I doubt
that's the case now. It's interesting to me that there are two seemingly
unrelated fixes:

1. Put the IP for heartbeat.belkin.com on a loopback
2. Manually add working DNS entries to affected PCs

Reports indicate that either fix works, but why? They seem unrelated to one
another unless the failing heartbeat messages mess up DNS handling on the
router.

I just saw a forum post where Belkin recommended manually setting DNS to
see if that solves the problem. Putting all of this together, this is my
best guess as to what happened.

1. Routers regularly send heartbeat messages to heartbeat.belkin.com
2. Some routing failure causes quite a few netblocks (but not all) to be
unreachable from Belkin's heartbeat server
3. If the heartbeat fails, something breaks related to DNS handling on the
router that does not resolve after a router reset

Very interesting. I don't have enough data yet, but I do wonder if the root
cause of this all is a routing problem on Belkin's side.

I can ping heartbeat.belkin.com and the DSL Reports link and other connected links are stating it was back up roughly 30 to 45 minutes ago, so I think we?re out of the woods.

I think it was initially suspected to be a firmware upgrade, but I doubt that's the case now. It's interesting to me that there are two seemingly unrelated fixes:

 

1. Put the IP for heartbeat.belkin.com <http://heartbeat.belkin.com>  on a loopback 

2. Manually add working DNS entries to affected PCs

 

Reports indicate that either fix works, but why? They seem unrelated to one another unless the failing heartbeat messages mess up DNS handling on the router.

Has anyone else tried the loopback/heartbeat workaround with success? I've
seen a few reports so far that this has temporarily solved the problem.

Why do that if Belkin is up and running again? Or are you suggesting that Belkin doesn?t have it all worked out?

Given the number of current social media postings, it doesn't appear that
they are back up yet, but I suppose it is hard to say for sure given the
number of people affected. Twitter is all aflutter with new reports of
people still having problems. Yours is the only report that indicated they
were working again. It could just be that it's taking a while for the
devices to correct themselves, or maybe they even need to be restarted or
something like that.

I've had a few companies tell me it fixed their problems.  A friend that
runs a call center said volume was way down an hour or two ago.

No, we?re still getting customer reports about the light staying orange. I was just hoping they were having other issues.  

 

I?ve just added 67.20.176.130 as a loopback in our network, too.

Given the number of current social media postings, it doesn't appear that they are back up yet, but I suppose it is hard to say for sure given the number of people affected. Twitter is all aflutter with new reports of people still having problems. Yours is the only report that indicated they were working again. It could just be that it's taking a while for the devices to correct themselves, or maybe they even need to be restarted or something like that.

Has anyone else tried the loopback/heartbeat workaround with success? I've seen a few reports so far that this has temporarily solved the problem.

I think it was initially suspected to be a firmware upgrade, but I doubt that's the case now. It's interesting to me that there are two seemingly unrelated fixes:

 

1. Put the IP for heartbeat.belkin.com <http://heartbeat.belkin.com>  on a loopback 

2. Manually add working DNS entries to affected PCs

 

Reports indicate that either fix works, but why? They seem unrelated to one another unless the failing heartbeat messages mess up DNS handling on the router.

So that it doesn't recur if things get dorked up, again?  It's a great DDoS vector - take down that IP, wedge every affected Belkin CPE on the Internet.

This kind of thing is extremely brittle, and apt to go into Sorcerer's Apprentice Mode without warning.

I just saw a report from another ISP who says they had a customer whose
VoIP continued to work and they were able to RDP into their computer from
the outside. It appears that only web traffic was broken. I wonder if
parental controls or web filtering are a component in this fiasco.

Frank,

I'd be very interested to hear if that helps. We're considering doing the
same thing since a couple of people have reported good results.

In my experience. It breaks DNS Masquerading. So any DNS query sent to the router goes unanswered. Verified this with a customer by having them hard-set their Local DNS (On their computer) to my public resolvers.
  
 I suspect anything that didn't require DNS worked fine (RDP inbound..SIP Outbound once it resolved the SBC Address. Assuming it had a DNS Hostname).
  
 The current thought (Around the NOC here) is that DNS is breaking due to another user friendly feature. Where the router forwards you to it's config page automatically, if it thinks you have no internet..

  I just saw a report from another ISP who says they had a customer whose VoIP continued to work and they were able to RDP into their computer from the outside. It appears that only web traffic was broken. I wonder if parental controls or web filtering are a component in this fiasco.

Given the number of current social media postings, it doesn't appear that they are back up yet, but I suppose it is hard to say for sure given the number of people affected. Twitter is all aflutter with new reports of people still having problems. Yours is the only report that indicated they were working again.

I think it was initially suspected to be a firmware upgrade, but I doubt that's the case now. It's interesting to me that there are two seemingly unrelated fixes: 

  

1. Put the IP for heartbeat.belkin.com on a loopback  

2. Manually add working DNS entries to affected PCs

This thing seems to go down and up like a yoyo.
(I?m seeing it one hop behind 66.179.229.150 ? works this very moment.)

Can?t get a reliable OS fingerprint (unless it?s an Airport Extreme?).
For extra fun, try nmapping it around the outages.
Sometimes it is like:

Interesting ports on 67.20.176.130:
Not shown: 1689 closed ports

199/tcp open     smux
445/tcp filtered microsoft-ds

What?

I had v6 routing loop issues with GTT as well and so did another person 
that i know.

The provider appears to have fixed it by doing a BGP pref change to 
Level3 or something

I still don't have a clear answer on this at my little ISP here.  I think the
above quote is exactly the problem though.  I had a few people start working
after a router reboot with the ping trick in place and others that couldn't get
going after the reboot.

I suspect the "bad firmware" that may also be (is also?) out there prevents it
from connecting ? though DHCP seems to complete ACK before it goes dead and you
never hear from the IP again.

Interestingly, it seems it's not just one IP anymore.

host heartbeat.belkin.com
heartbeat.belkin.com has address 54.163.87.225

I still don't have a clear answer on this at my little ISP here.  I think the
above quote is exactly the problem though.  I had a few people start working
after a router reboot with the ping trick in place and others that couldn't get
going after the reboot.

I suspect the "bad firmware" that may also be (is also?) out there prevents it
from connecting ? though DHCP seems to complete ACK before it goes dead and you
never hear from the IP again.

Interestingly, it seems it's not just one IP anymore.

It's not just the local.  8.8.8.8 is caching the old entry still.
Check the authoritative resolvers.

Most of our resolvers show that same long list.  I assume in a few hours they all will, once the TTL expires.

Your large host list looks like it is just your local resolver.

 

host heartbeat.belkin.com <http://heartbeat.belkin.com>  8.8.8.8

Using domain server:

I still don't have a clear answer on this at my little ISP here.  I think the
above quote is exactly the problem though.  I had a few people start working
after a router reboot with the ping trick in place and others that couldn't get
going after the reboot.

I suspect the "bad firmware" that may also be (is also?) out there prevents it
from connecting ? though DHCP seems to complete ACK before it goes dead and you
never hear from the IP again.

Interestingly, it seems it's not just one IP anymore.

It looks to me, when querying Belkin's setup directly, they are
returning RR A records.  (Please pay attention to the "QUESTION SECTION"
below, as it's going to become relevant):

$ dig @a.gtld-servers.net ns belkin.com.

;; QUESTION SECTION:

heartbeat.belkin.com.   3600    IN      A       54.83.179.150

And here's the SOA -- note the serial (it's in YYYYMMDDxx notation):

$ dig @ns1.p06.dynect.net soa belkin.com.

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;belkin.com.                    IN      SOA

However using 8.8.8.8 doing the exact same queries doesn't return RR A,
it only returns a single record:

$ dig @8.8.8.8 ns belkin.com

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;belkin.com.                    IN      NS

belkin.com.             21010   IN      NS      ns2.p06.dynect.net.
belkin.com.             21010   IN      NS      ns3.p06.dynect.net.

$ dig @8.8.8.8 a heartbeat.belkin.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:

Change the query type to ANY (rather than A) and suddenly:

$ dig @8.8.8.8 any heartbeat.belkin.com

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;heartbeat.belkin.com.          IN      ANY

$ dig @8.8.8.8 soa belkin.com.

Who knows what Google is doing under the hood here.  Gut feeling is they
have something cached -- this would imply Belkin was using a single A
record originally, then all this happened, and it forced them to move to
RR A records, but something within Google's own DNS infrastructure is
still returning the old cached copy.  Note that 67.20.176.130 doesn't
even appear in the RR list.

I wouldn't be surprised if somehow this was tickled by someone at Belkin
botching a DNS update (forgetting to increment serial, for example).

Just a heads up to our friends at Google Apps.

Despite the status page saying all is peachy:
http://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&v=status

...the administration page for any Google Apps for domains is totally
rogered.  It's either an endless redirect loop or a deluge of errors.

I'd call for premium support, but I can't even see that.

Again, a friendly heads up and nudge that perhaps the status page should at
least be updated to reflect the fact that it's non-operational.

Users are seeing the Admin console refresh continuously on loading.

Subject: [outages] Akamai problems on east coast/Verizon?
Message-ID: <D3BF33CF-7FBD-469D-B404-9612883FC152@semihuman.com>

I've seen two sites now fronted by Akamai - travelocity.com and retailmenot.com - produce "DNS Failure" errors from the edge, suggesting Akamai edge servers unable to reach back-end caches or origin servers. Anyone else noticing this?

IPs I've seen for the edge sites in question:

[~/]$ host www.travelocity.com
www.travelocity.com is an alias for www.travelocity.com.edgekey.net.
www.travelocity.com.edgekey.net is an alias for e8329.b.akamaiedge.net.
e8329.b.akamaiedge.net has address 23.203.11.138

[~/]$ host www.retailmenot.com
www.retailmenot.com is an alias for wildcard.retailmenot.com.edgekey.net.
wildcard.retailmenot.com.edgekey.net is an alias for e3849.b.akamaiedge.net.
e3849.b.akamaiedge.net has address 172.231.217.199

I'm on a Verizon Jetpack right now in eastern Maryland, if that helps...

Thanks,

Point of order:

No "resolvers" are "authoritative".  "Resolvers" (or, more fully, "Customer
resolver servers") are servers operated (generally) by "eyeball carriers" 
for their end-users to utilize to do DNS lookups, so that the end users
are not required to operate a resolver themselves -- which most enduser 
operating systems have not, historically done.  Resolvers do the recursing
for you, and return a non-authoritative response.

Putting this at the ISP level leverages caching (though sometimes 
pathologically).

Many edge routers perform this task, though not all.

"Authoritative" is a term used to describe a "Zone" server; one which has
a current local or slaved copy of the actual source data for a zone.  
Queries directly to a zone server will have the authoritative bit set.

Cheers,

Works fine now as of 11:29 UTC.
The first i noticed any issues was at ~11:12 UTC (i was offline before
then).
Someone else indicated that the outage lasted ~33 minutes.

This was seen in Australia, as well, same approximate times and duration.

Subject: [outages] Century Link/Qwest Outage
Message-ID: <1413431628.75584.YahooMailNeo@web162706.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>



Does anyone else experience routing issue for websites hosted on CDN from CenturyLink's edge router?

jfk-brdr-04.inet.qwest.net [67.14.5.98] 
 63.146.26.2


I can't open multiple websites if routing goes through their JFK edge router. It's been happening over 24 hours and no resolution from Century Link/Qwest.
Same sites will open if route goes through dcx2-edge-01.inet.qwest.net [67.14.28.66] or nyc-edge-05.inet.qwest.net [205.171.134.10] or chp-brdr-03.inet.qwest.net [67.14.8.194] edge router.

Thank you,
Vipul Desai

The Internet as a whole has been fine for me. A few things that might help
others identify with you:

- General geographic location (DNS trickery--see Geographic DNS Routing)
- Your ISP
- The nature of your issue (are DNS queries slow, is the problem latency,
loss, etc)
- IPv4 or IPv6
- Residential or Business service

size issue for them since I've been on hold to report the issue for 15
minutes which I interpret to mean that their call center is getting
slammed!

Hey all,

Anyone seeing a large influx of broadcast traffic since a little after 3pm
EDT on the Equinix exchange in Chicago?

Opening a ticket with Equinix, but just curious if any others have seen
anything.

I tracked it down to an offending device belonging to 123.net. Still
haven't received any peep out of Equinix support.

There seems to be similar issues in Ashburn as well. These are the only 123Net peering points.

Good to know. I've emailed the 4 contacts on their peeringdb page. No
responses yet.

Hi,

There was a MRV Optiswitch failure (pause of BPDUs) in the network that 
created this storm.  The failed node has been isolated.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

Just a heads up: XO is evidently having issues with certain that box routing out via Megapath. 

Impacted scope is unknown, but it at least includes parts of the 64.0.0.0/14 netblock. No ETR  at this time.

It seems to have now mysteriously gone away/cleared up.  Not at all
sure what was going on there.  I'd written it off initially as an
issue with my laptop (OSX since a while back seems to need a reboot
every few weeks if you've Parallels installed and use it - something
inside the network stack goes nuts)

Okay, good to hear! That's very odd. Let me know if it happens again and
you need someone to check into it.

Thanks,

Level3?s experiencing a massive back hoe outage. Reports started in Seattle, but now is being reported across the West Coast - updates from there still open ticket: 

Reverse cron
10/20/14 7:10:56 PM GMT	 The IP NOC continues to work with the Transport NOC to develop additional services routes so the impacted IP traffic can be migrated to relieve some overutilization. Simultaneously, the Transport NOC has advised that Field Services have arrived onsite and are now assessing the damage while working develop a repair strategy for this case. This is no ETTR for this case at this time.
10/20/14 6:29:31 PM GMT	 The IP NOC has specified that while working to add the necessary bandwidth to mitigate to overutilization causing the IP and Voice service impact, they are also working to re-route services, when possible, to expedite service restoral. The troubleshooting process for this case is ongoing and the IP NOC is unable to provide an ETTR for this case at this time.
10/20/14 6:07:50 PM GMT	 The IPNOC and Transport NOCs efforts to increase the bandwidth between the over utilized markets is being done to expedite service restoral for the impacted markets. The Transport NOC is also working to repair the damaged cable in El Centro, CA. At this time, Field services has isolated the root cause of the break to a construction project and outside plant engineers have been dispatched to the damage site with an ETA of 18:30 GMT. A splice crew has also been dispatched to the failure site with an ETA of 20:00 GMT.
10/20/14 5:56:31 PM GMT	 The IP NOC has advised that the fiber damage was impacting their connectivity to the impacted equipment in the various markets. The IP NOC has resolved the connectivity issue and continues to work with the Transport NOC to increase the bandwidth in the impacted markets.
10/20/14 4:56:40 PM GMT	 The IP NOC has advised that this issue is now impacting multiple markets across the Western United States the event case has been adjusted to reflect the change. The IP NOC has determined that a fiber cut in El Centro, CA has caused multiple route failures between various these western. Specifically, the fiber damage impacted multiple backbones and has caused overutilization between these markets. The IP NOC has engaged the Transport NOC help mitigate the Voice and IP service failure for this case.

Our last queue check reported DNS failures looking up <domain

Just picking one, staples.com:

Anyone else seeing this?  A colleague says that O365 is having issues and

I was seeing what looked like "general slowness" when it came to
getting A, MX, or ANY back for staples-com.mail.protection.outlook.com.
Much of the delay (using +trace on dig) showed high latency in a couple
spots, but I never saw any actual timeouts:

;; Received 763 bytes from 192.5.5.241#53(f.root-servers.net) in 885 ms
;; Received 871 bytes from 192.48.79.30#53(j.gtld-servers.net) in 368 ms
;; Received 203 bytes from 65.55.37.62#53(ns1.msft.net) in 204 ms
;; Received 141 bytes from 134.170.140.11#53(ns1-gtm.glbdns.o365filtering.com) in 168 ms

Total response time was roughly 4-5 full seconds.  This was around 15:07:40
Pacific Time or so, give or take 3-4 minutes.

Presently I'm not able to reproduce the behaviour; response times seem
to be decent now (1 second tops), with the majority of the remaining
delays being here:

;; Received 203 bytes from 208.84.2.53#53(ns2.msft.net) in 305 ms
;; Received 141 bytes from 157.56.116.52#53(ns1-gtm.glbdns.o365filtering.com) in 409 ms

Nothing looks bad via mtr, except in the case of packets from me to
157.56.116.52, which appears to be going to Europe (I'm under the
impression "ams" refers to Amsterdam):

15. xe-10-2-2-0.bl2-96c-1b.ntwk.msn.net (204.152.140.87)             0.0%    47    46  83.5  83.5  81.3  95.1
16. ae11-0.nyc-96cbe-1b.ntwk.msn.net (207.46.45.85)                 37.8%    46    28  84.8  85.2  82.3  97.8
17. xe-0-3-1-0.lts-96cbe-1b.ntwk.msn.net (207.46.43.47)              0.0%    46    46 156.7 157.1 154.5 165.7
18. xe-2-2-2-0.ams-96c-1a.ntwk.msn.net (207.46.44.59)                4.3%    46    44 167.1 164.8 163.4 172.0
19. ???

The latencies here are likely normal, packet loss may be ICMP
prioritisation-related (can't tell because destination or preceding
routers don't respond to ICMP), but it does bring into question if
Microsoft has a form of geo-located GSLB (if not, ignore.  If so, why
are queries from the US west coast going to Europe).

It seems to have now mysteriously gone away/cleared up.  Not at all
sure what was going on there.  I'd written it off initially as an
issue with my laptop (OSX since a while back seems to need a reboot
every few weeks if you've Parallels installed and use it - something
inside the network stack goes nuts)

Okay, good to hear! That's very odd. Let me know if it happens again and
you need someone to check into it.

Thanks,

I received two confirmations off list of the issue ? thanks.   The one observed it from 4:27 pm and 5:11 pm, Central.

 

Josh, you were checking just the MX records, but before any email server can actually connect to the email server it has to resolve staples-com.mail.protection.outlook.com, which was not working at the time of my original post.

Anyone else seeing this?  A colleague says that O365 is having issues and

I just pored through our own email logs ? the issue first cropped up at 4:17 pm Central and the last failure I see is 5:01 pm, Central.  But looking at delivery, the last delivery was at 4:22 pm and the first delivery was at 4:58 pm.  So different domains may have started resolving at different times.

I received two confirmations off list of the issue ? thanks.   The one observed it from 4:27 pm and 5:11 pm, Central.

 

Josh, you were checking just the MX records, but before any email server can actually connect to the email server it has to resolve staples-com.mail.protection.outlook.com, which was not working at the time of my original post.

We have a fiber provider outage that's cut all our AT-DC links.  Looking 
at MTR's, I have to wonder if Comcast is suffering the same fate right 
now.

I'm not seeing any loss on our side. This is from the first Comcast router

Long RTT, but it's long distance, so totally what I'd expect. What's
interesting to me is the huge RTT in your trace. You might want to check
with Highwinds Network Group or Universo Online to see if they can
troubleshoot from their network back to you. The path on our side looks
good from initial observations.

HTTPv6 was back up at 7:15 pm Central, so down time was about 50 minutes.

Message-ID: <CAONB_-JKmhiwRhqC530qt56=pDeoP=aUDVnqORDKY3-ZGH-gZg@mail.gmail.com>

Since about midnight (Eastern) Comcast's DNS (75.75.75.7[5,6]) has been
giving timeouts and the occasional 'no route to host' from Vermont.
Switched our resolvers to use Google's Public DNS (via the same Comcast
line) and all services returned to normal.

Packet traces aren't interesting (just outbound traffic, no responses) and
traceroutes to the cdn usually succeed.  dns.comcast.net reports no
problems.  Queries at the command line sometimes succeed, sometimes fail,
sometimes take a long time to finish.

Bill,

 

I believe Comcast has anycasted their DNS servers, so if you could provide a traceroute to each IP then if Comcast personnel are lurking they can better guess which one it is.

At home I have Comcast in Colchester, VT, I have systems monitoring a 
bunch of points from outside and inside including a RIPE ATLAS PROBE,  
using Comcast DNS listed below.   None of my systems reported an drop or 
degradation of any service.   Sorry, I do not have a mtr to provide.

John,

A number of your anycast nodes for 75.75.75.75 and 75.75.76.76 appear
to be rate limiting ICMP rather aggressively.

I'd recommend cranking this up for purposes of troubleshooting.

Best,

Sorry for the off-topic post, but Google has not yielded much so I thought
I would ask here.

Does anyone know of, or have a script that can take in ip blocklists from
https://www.iblocklist.com/lists.php and update a router's ACL? (IOS 12.x)

I think that would be a great example of how to use a TCL script with EEM.

Seeing issues connecting to a number of .mil MX servers this morning

I'm able to reproduce the issue from external hosts so I don't
*believe* it's just us, but still investigating.

Anyone else seeing this?

Hello,

Our network is also unable resolve MX records for a number of .mil domains. Not sure of the root cause. What information do you have thus far?

Is it possible for someone to provide output from something like

The examples I've received so far from folks match the same thing I'm
seeing from two separate/unrelated connections (meaning I clearly get
back MX records, and all those have A records (dig a fqdn)), so I'm
hoping Blake and Ray can run the same and determine what's failing and
where.  :-)
