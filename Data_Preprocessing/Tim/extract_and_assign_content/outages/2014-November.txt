Subject: [outages] Time Warner Cable through Verizon (Wash. DC Metro):
	Packet Loss
Message-ID: <54594557.9080406@neovera.com>

Greetings Outages.org recipients,

Since yesterday, 03-NOV-2014 around 07:12AM EST, two systems on separate
Time-Warner Cable (TWC) accounts have been experiencing intermittent and
severe packet loss between TWC in NYC and my network in Ashburn, VA.

I've run MTR to the equipment on TWC.  The loss I see in that direction
is on the last two hops only.  When I traceroute back to my network from
TWC, and see packet loss, it's between TWC and Verizon.

Does anyone have any insight into this problem that, for the moment,
appears to be between TWC and Verizon in the DC metro area?

Regards,
Michael Hertrick

Well, the second to last hops have different addresses, but that doesn't mean
they're not the same concentrator; annoying as hell that mtr -r won't show
both names and IPs, isn't it?

Are the remote TWC locations both near one another?

Do you have reports from them that they have trouble getting other places
on the internet?  Speed tests showing problems?  etc?

Cheers,

My first inclination was to believe there was(?) an issue in Washington
DC affecting Verizon given the data presented, but I couldn't
definitively say "yeah that's where it is" because of a couple things:

1. It would have been nice to get a return traceroute/mtr from Site 2
back to wherever, both when the problem was occurring and when it
wasn't.

2. I had great difficultly figuring out where each of these traceroutes
and mtrs were run from and to.  The descriptions given in your preceding
paragraphs are hard to follow: "mtr to the equipment on TWC",
"traceroute back to my network from TWC", "loss between TWC and
Verizon", "traceroute back from Site 1 (TWC)".

The latter is easiest accomplished by providing source/destination IP
addresses for every single mtr/traceroute you provide (I tend to put
them at the top; here's an example[1]), but since some privacy is
required here, you could have used labels consistently across the board
(e.g. "Site 1 (ISP)", "Site 2 (ISP)", "My Network (ISP)").

In RE: Time Warner Cable through Verizon (Wash. DC Metro): Packet Loss
 
I also have the same intermittent packet loss issue between my twc site and verizon fios site.  The problem started yesterday.  The packet loss seems to occur at xe-5-1-2.gw12.iad8.alter.net [204.148.11.85].    It is itermittent, but when when I do a traceroute during the downtime the losses seem to occur at this hop.
 
I hope this issue gets resolved soon.

Since my original e-mail, I've checked the fine man page and I should
have run `mtr -wbc <seconds> <address>` to get names and addresses
together.

They're about a mile or less apart.

The folks on-site in NYC have reported being able to reach their
other, usual web sites on the Internet without issue.  It's actually
difficult for me to get anyone on-site to run any tests because they
typically leave when things aren't working right.  I know... problem
solved, right? (I wish)

I see that Albert Yuen with Raymond Fong MD replied to this thread and
has corroborated my story.  He may be in a better position to run
additional tests from the TWC at NYC side of things than I am.

I'll say...  Thanks for the info, Adam.

Anyway, I was about to make some BGP configuration modifications when
I noticed that TWC was no longer carrying my traffic to WDC and
handing it off to Verizon.  It's being handed off to TATA in NYC
before heading down to WDC on NTT.

I'm not sure precisely when that change occurred, but my ping monitors
to the TWC sites have been stable for about 2.5 hours.

If the problem returns for me, I'll most likely take Verizon out of
the path altogether and won't be of any further use for
troubleshooting/testing this issue.

Thanks, all.

Interesting that you say that. We have been having problems with customers
in NY that are using Verizon FiOS. What is interesting is clients in NJ
that are using Verizon FiOS are taking the exact same path (layer 3) with
no problem. We are also having issues with traffic coming from equipment
that is hosted by Verizon in St. Denis, France. I suspect there is some
layer1/2 device out there in NY that is having issues.

Working on an issue for some customer and found that LSI is in the midst of
a wide area outage.

Comment is from LSI NOC

Comment:

While our investigation is still underway we are now of the opinion this
event is carrier agnostic.  There are confirmed reports of latency and
outages on the I-95 corridor from Boston to Baltimore.  There are a
multitude of carriers reporting these common symptoms which we have
validated by way of looking glass websites, partner carriers and more.

Message-ID: <20141107014915.GD8489@angus.ind.WPI.EDU>

We lost several dark fiber circuits out of Lightower in Worcester, MA.
There is a manhole fire down the street at Main St. & Highland
St. that is most likely the cause.  Smoke is billowing out of several
manholes.  NGrid, NStar, police & fire are on the scene.  Lightower
has dispatched techs.  No ETR yet.

One other of my circuits that leaves the building via a diverse path
is still up luckily, or we'd be off the net entirely.

San Diego and NYC.
Seems to have cleared up now, but I was seeing line protocol on the tunnel between sites drop along with packet loss.
We have GRE which lands on a level3 circuit on both sides to force it over their network the entire time.

Where are these sites? Not seeing abnormal loss on our 40+ circuits.

We started seeing ~50% loss at about 5:46pm pst between sites which ultimately forced us to move to backup circuits.

I've been having issues w/ google IPv6 (more-or-less all services
operating over 80/443 have been really bad, though imap/993 has had
issues also) for at least 18 hours from a SixXS tunnel which terminates
in Ashburn.

Coming from 2001:4830:167b:: and generally getting
2607:f8b0:4006:80a::1007 or other things in 2607:f8b0:4002::,
2607:f8b0:4004::, or 2607:f8b0:4006::

No issues w/ other IPv6 traffic.

"me too" (I'm in Seattle, USA)

I've narrowed down this issue to Google ignoring ICMPv6 PTBs.  It
sometimes works sporadically for me, though.  Here's an example w/some
tcpdumps:

http://www.prolixium.com/share/txt/google-ipv6-pmtud-fail.txt

Relevant lines are the following:

13:51:34.046171 IP6 2001:48c8:1:2::2 > 2607:f8b0:4005:802::1006: ICMP6,
packet too big, mtu 1280, length 1240
13:51:34.562579 IP6 2607:f8b0:4005:802::1006.443 >
2001:48c8:1:105:21c:c0ff:feb2:8dbd.33936: Flags [.], seq 1:1429, ack
279, win 232, options [nop,nop,TS val 3392471676 ecr 756572814], length
1428

Google never lowers the packet length and so the connection times out.
As others have mentioned, this only really affects tunneled users.

I've seen other organizations break this over the years but I never
thought Google would make the list..

Nice work Mark!

It only started for me about a week ago.  I've had my HE tunnel for years.
I wonder if they just enabled IPv6 service to that particular web property,
or if they made a recent config change.
Anyways, I wonder if someone from Google reads the outages list, or if
NANOG should be CC'd to get their attention.

The last email update I received was:

Sat, 8 Nov 2014 07:21:07 -0500

ETTR: Not at this time
Current Update: Fiber reroute still ongoing, no ETTR as of yet.

However, all the circuits I have visibility to are restored, other
than one circuit on a diverse path out of the building that got
knocked offline while repairs were happening to the first path.  That
incident took my campus entirely offline for several hours early this
morning until a manual workaround was put into place.

What a "fun" 2 days this was.  I hope we find out what caused the
explosion/fire in the first place... I think it was some kind of
electrical fault.

Not much news on this one, but I did find this which gets the details
wrong (location should be Lincoln Square, not Lincoln St.):

We had a few reports of not being able to dial out but not all outcalls seemed to be affected and we were receiving calls.  WS said it was a nation-wide issue that was getting extreme priority.  Things got back to normal by about 11am EST.  Keeping an eye on it, though, since the tech also mentioned that they were still getting reports that indicated it was sporadic and may intermittently still affect some customers.

Looks like the list web interface is down and the usual mailman 
<LISTNAME>-leave unsub method isn't working either. Perhaps a benevolent 
admin could take care of your unsub request?

just had a chance to catch up on this email, i had a ticket open between
LAX and VA, that had problems.


their response was and i quote

"Called customer and spoke with *****. I let him know that our Core
engineers found that there was a backbone transport issue between DC and
LAX that was causing traffic to shift onto a backup path which got
saturated as we started hitting peak usage times. That trouble has now
cleared and the main backbone link is now up. We will hold this ticket for
24 hours. If you have any further trouble, let us know and we will look
back into the issue."

hope that helps others :)

>From WS:

Please be advised that the higher level Outage that was causing your service interruption was resolved as of 11:06am eastern on Monday. Windstream VNOC techs identified an STP link on our network that was congested and shut that STP down to restore service. This was a temporary fix to restore traffic and once the permanent fix is in place, an official RFO will be sent out.

This cleared up around 9:55am CST.  Still waiting for the official report from Windstream on what happened.

We are seeing Windstream SIP trunk outages in the Midwest beginning at 10:55am today. We had the same issue on Friday 11am-2:30pm Central. Anyone else seeing these issues?

(replying to this thread from nanog on outages...)

like david below, we've been getting reports this morning from customers 
unable to reach various web sites.

investigating a number of these reports, the one commonality is level3 
in chicago. sites are reachable from level3/cincinnati but not 
level3/chicago.

traceroutes make it one hop past our bgp peer and seem to die there.

for one particular remote web server (node1104.follett.com, and possibly 
others) traceroutes and pings from level3's looking glass (using chicago 
as the site) complete successfully, while neither does when ran from my 
gear through the same site.

This domain name has three name servers but all of them have the same
IP address!

% check-soa -i networksolutions.com
ns1.netsol.com.
	209.17.114.135: OK: 2014103001 (19 ms)
ns2.netsol.com.

ns3.netsol.com.
	209.17.114.135: OK: 2014103001 (20 ms)

So, any IP problem (routing, filtering, whatever) will take them down
at the same time. 

What to add? It is Network Solutions. The gods themselves cannot make
them professionnal.

By the way, nslookup is a poor DNS debugging tool.

Also reporting the same, we saw this get really bad a little before 2:00 AM America/Chicago, and recover around 4:20.

either.

We're seeing some issues with Windstream voice in the Northeast, calls to
Windstream customers seem to be either returning a fast busy or generic
"network difficulties" message.  Their customer support 800 #'s also seem
to be down (maybe due to call volume?), so I'd guess this is somewhat
widespread.

Appears to be affecting data services as well. Just had a customer contact me with an outage of his sites on Windstream MPLS. Looked like prefixes were disappearing and being re-announced in BGP since about 6PM.

Windstream had a major outage in NYC with their upstream transport carrier Verizon. Verizon lost an OC48 rumored to contain around 8,600 PRI?s. We lost 12 PRI?s in our Long Island City office with service being restored Sunday afternoon.

Monday, the same transport carrier lost a DS3 that took 5 of our PRI?s out of service. At 6 pm last night, we lost our entire MPLS from Windstream for about 45 minutes.

As of this morning, everything is up and operational and stable.

There?s only 1600 T-1?s in an OC-48, so 8,600 PRIs is not possible.

Subject: [outages] Windstream - Voice

 

We're seeing some issues with Windstream voice in the Northeast, calls to Windstream customers seem to be either returning a fast busy or generic "network difficulties" message.  Their customer support 800 #'s also seem to be down (maybe due to call volume?), so I'd guess this is somewhat widespread.

There?s only 1600 T-1?s in an OC-48, so 8,600 PRIs is not possible.

Windstream had a major outage in NYC with their upstream transport carrier Verizon. Verizon lost an OC48 rumored to contain around 8,600 PRI?s. We lost 12 PRI?s in our Long Island City office with service being restored Sunday afternoon.

Monday, the same transport carrier lost a DS3 that took 5 of our PRI?s out of service. At 6 pm last night, we lost our entire MPLS from Windstream for about 45 minutes.

As of this morning, everything is up and operational and stable.

We were seeing the same thing. I finally got through to support and they confirmed a widespread outage that took out both of their call centers. Techs and noc working on it now.
