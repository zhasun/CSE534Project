 "We had another cut today between Dubai and Muscat three hours back.
The cable was about 80G capacity, it had telephone, Internet data,
everything," one Flag official, who declined to be named, told Zawya
Dow Jones.
The cable, known as Falcon, delivers services to countries in the
Mediterranean and Gulf region, he added.

Hmmm. I thought I saw Osama putting on his diving suit... ***SHRUG*** :)

Have there been any ETAs named yet for all three of these cable repairs?

We have an office in India and it made me think, when these American
companies decided to outsource to India, did any of them consider ANY
of the telecom infrastructure over there? I don't want to come across
as negative but our experiences with all the telecom providers over in
India have been horrible! Echoey PSTN networks, extreme network
congestion, etc...

Hi Mike, 

I haven't see anything. ETA are difficult to give. For example, is a ship available or is it already in the middle of a job. These ships are quite busy. Not only do they do repairs for undersea optics, but they lay cables for offshore oil platforms, regional cables, etc. 

And even if a ship is available, maybe it has to return to port for provisioning (pick up fiber optic cable stockpiled by the undersea cable system or some of its repeaters). 

And then the ship has to locate the fault. You can't calculate the exact point where a failure has occurred. So you have to look for it with an unmanned submarine. 

Lots of potential headaches.

Dear All,



Thought I?d give you all an update on where we (FLAG) are with the cable
cuts ?



FEA Segment D - The Cable ship CS Certamen is now expected to arrive at
the Alexandria repair ground on Wednesday 6^th February. A Permit for
the repair is currently being expedited with the Egyptian authorities.



FEA Segment M - The cable ship CS Asean Restorer has been booked for
this repair. It is currently out on an APCN repair and with current plan
will be ready to start any work on our cable on or after 11th Feb. We
have the OTDR traces from Penang and see that the fault is around 28km
out from the station.



FALCON Segment 7b (Bandra Abbas ? Al Seeb) - E-Marine continues to await
the permit to enter the Iranian waters and current forecast for the ship
to start a work is around 19^th February.



FALCON Segment 2 - Fault 1^st February 41km from repeater, which is
between the first two repeaters out of Dubai toward Muscat (Al Seeb).
The ship has left Abu Dhabi and is on route to the repair ground. The
repair is expected to start in the next 12 hours (weather permitting).



FALCON Segment 7a - Fault 1^st February between BND (Bandar Abbas, Iran)
and KWI (Kuwait), we are waiting for ship to go out and it maybe fixed
before going out the fault on 7b ? to be confirmed.



I hope this helps,

Couldn't get to your voice mail at home or work Wednesday or Thursday -- or
leave a message on some phones?

Neither could any other California customers with voice mail on their
Verizon Communications Inc. land lines.

A database error in a central server in Ontario froze the software for all
740,000 land-line customers subscribing to Verizon's voice mail early
Wednesday, and the state's second-largest telephone company couldn't say
late Thursday when the problem would be fixed.

"Unfortunately, it's a huge file and it's taking a long time," said Verizon
spokesman Jonathan Davies. "All our resources are deployed, and we'll have
it back up as soon as possible."

Most of Verizon's 3 million land-line customers are in Southern
California's affluent beach communities and the Inland Empire. The outage
did not affect Verizon Wireless customers.

Via Reuters.

[snip]

E-mail service of Research In Motion's BlackBerry smartphones experienced a
"critical severity outage" on Monday, the company told clients in an
e-mail.

"This is an emergency notification regarding the current BlackBerry
Infrastructure outage," RIM support account manager Bryan Simpson said in
an e-mail. The message said the outage affected enterprise clients and
"users of the Americas network."

RIM was not immediately available for comment and its e-mail gave no
estimate on when service may be restored or how many individuals could be
affected.

Last April, a massive outage crashed BlackBerry service across North
America, leaving thousands of users without access to wireless e-mail.

Thanks.  We started seeing the issue about 2 - 2 1/2 hours ago.  Looks
like their support lines are down, too.  The message on the line is
saying their support phone system is having issues and is currently
down.  Fun times.

Via Reuters.

E-mail service of Research In Motion's BlackBerry smartphones experienced a
"critical severity outage" on Monday, the company told clients in an
e-mail.

"This is an emergency notification regarding the current BlackBerry
Infrastructure outage," RIM support account manager Bryan Simpson said in
an e-mail. The message said the outage affected enterprise clients and
"users of the Americas network."

RIM was not immediately available for comment and its e-mail gave no
estimate on when service may be restored or how many individuals could be
affected.

Last April, a massive outage crashed BlackBerry service across North
America, leaving thousands of users without access to wireless e-mail.

This outage seems to be sporadic; one of my test emails made it  
through, but browser access & wireless activation do not work.

Via eWeek.

[snip]

One of Salesforce.com's key North American CRM servers, NA5, was up and
down for most of the business day Feb. 11 following a software upgrade, a
Salesforce customer who asked to remain anonymous told eWEEK.

The unstable server caused some havoc in an unspecified number of
customers' accounts, the customer said.

The software upgrade was installed over the weekend, but at 8:22 a.m.
Pacific time, the company's internal server information Web page said, "NA5
Service Degradation: The technology operations team has been made aware of
intermittent service disruptions to NA5. Please check back for further
updates."

Salesforce.com, based in San Francisco, subsequently reported similar
"service degradations" at 9:26 a.m., 10:19 a.m., 11:23 p.m. and 12:20 p.m.
before announcing at 2:04 p.m. that "the Salesforce.com Technology team has
restored the service issue with NA5 at 22:11 UTC. We apologize for any
inconvenience this may have caused you."

The tech op team did not specify exactly what the root cause of the problem
was. That information may be posted by tomorrow, a Salesforce.com employee
told eWEEK. The employee did not want his name used because he is not
authorized to speak for the company.

A Salesforce.com spokesperson has not returned calls from eWEEK at this
time.

FYI, Everything is still peachy around Alaska. Talked to a few other BB
users and everything has been on the UP and UP. 

Hope you all get it back soon, I know what a pain it can be seeing your
beautiful BB and not being able to use it *laugh*

I don't have a destination address which would work as a proper return
path (utilising Level 3 in Seattle), so I tried multiples.  These are
from Santa Clara, California.

The latency is due to the fact that I'm trying to reach my host running
sprint cdma card :-)

Subject: Power Fun at 151 Front Street, Toronto


Hi all,

Today is Diesel Day at 151 Front Street, where the building owner shuts down 
all grid power to allow intrusive power maintenance to happen, and the building 
is fed by generator power only.

At least one suite on the 6th floor has been affected by a generator failure, 
so far.

Just thought I'd pass on the news, in case there's anybody here who is 
scratching their heads about equipment or sessions down in Toronto which seem 
to have no rational cause. Most ISPs in the building (and the TorIX) have 
engineers on-site; if you have equipment located there which needs some TLC and 
you have no immediate/regular access to remote hands, let me know off-list and 
I'll try to put you in touch with someone who has appropriate access: I'm not 
on-site, but I have phone numbers for people who are.


Joe

Seeing issues with XO transit in Philly as well. Based on customer
reports we received, it appears to be XO -> Qwest or vice versa that was
most heavily affected. Traceroutes out died 1 hop into XO's network, and
ingress traceroutes died within Qwest's network before even reaching XO.

Power outages are cascading through many parts of South Florida, with
Florida Power & Light and others reporting blackouts in portions of Miami,
Doral, Westchester, Pembroke Pines, Miramar and Boca Raton.

Many traffic lights are not working and nine accidents were reported in
Miami-Dade County between 1:04 p.m. and 1:26 p.m. Police agencies were
dispatching officers to as many intersections as possible.

The lights flickered off at several South Florida hospitals, which had to
switch to generator power.

''We had a blip here and the generators kicked in immediately,'' Jackson
Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Lorraine Nelson said.

Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach and Baptist Hospital in Southwest
Miami-Dade reported similar situations.

A spokeswoman for FPL said the company was investigating the extent and
cause of the problem.

Also, CNN television is reporting that 8 power generation plants
are "offline" and an investigation is ongoing...

XO says all clear. Claims a core router failure as the cause, although
the first guy I talked to said it was a DNS problem. Internetpluse.net
shows XO looking normal again as well.

Pondering bringing my XO transit back up. Anyone still seeing issues?

Paul,

You may want to relay to various lists that two nuclear reactors at Turkey
Point (that's South of Miami) have been shut down. Reason given is
precautionary measures.
AP reported that there were fighter jets overhead, but that is NOT
confirmed.
At this time FPL reports that av. 4 million customers are affected.
All schools are dismissed at this time. Expected time of restoration is up
to 10 hours.

Contrary to news reports on CNN and AP there were NOT eight nor five
reactors affected. We haven't got that many:)
The Crystal River reactor and St. Lucie twin reactors (fossil and gas) have
not been affected, though all have noticed the drain dip of course. 

Operations at Turkey Point is now near back to normal with less than 100,000
customers state wide to be restored. Full completion expected around 07:00
PM this evening.

=======
Grid status:
An apparent massive equipment failure at a Florida Power & Light substation
in the Miami area triggered the two nuclear reactors at the company's Turkey
Point to halt. The Fla Nuclear Commission confirmed this. The shut reactors
caused sub grids 4,5, 6, 7 and 8 to drain power from up state and west
state, as the Dade/Broward counties have a high demand. Restoration time
update: between 06:00 and 07:00 PM near to normal operation is expected.

There was indeed a squad off McDill in the air near the coastal plant, but
that's a daily routine. There is NO reason to assume this has anything to do
with the reactor closing.

Subject: [Outages] Abovenet Routing Instability
Message-ID: <A020FB4C57CEE249BD8F80C96590AC9618241E0688@MBX01.corp.safesecureweb.com>

Had a bunch of calls come in from customers starting around 1:15 PM. Put in a call to Abovenet and was told they're experiencing a "global routing issue".  Also received an email from them around 8:10 AM EST today indicating that they had experienced an issue with their backbone but that it had been resolved. We've shut down our Abovenet transit and all customers are seeing normal availability again.

Anybody got any additional info with regard to this?

D.

I have no details of the problem, but can confirm what you're seeing;
Abovenet MPLS connectivity between Santa Clara and Virginia is severed
as well.

I also saw the notice Abovenet sent earlier this morning about the
"backbone issue", though at that time we saw nothing.
