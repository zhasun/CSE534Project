Message-ID: <6cd462c00912162345gdb71922n26229ab485b3fc6f@mail.gmail.com>

My "regular" AT&T GSM cell can't seem to successfully call or receive calls.

Any news? AT&T Coverage and reliability in the Bay Area is getting
worse, and worse, and.... this is starting ti get really bad.

Thanks,

I've had a couple of calls from customers asking if we are down (our email
servers) or if it's Blackberry that's down.      I've sent a few test
messages and they do not come to my BB but they do come to my desktop.
The people who have called are on Verizon and are in the Chattanooga, TN
market.

Just had a customer notify me of the same issue here. I switched from my BB 
to an Android phone, so I can't confirm it myself, but would seem that there 
is a problem currently at BB.

Most intelligent post I have seen on this thread yet.

Why do people continue to pay extra for Blackberry's service when all they get are extraneous points of failure?

Blackberry offered a unique service about 10 years ago, but today they offer a less robust and more failure prone version of what you can do with 75% of cell phones and a corporate Exchange server.  If you don't care about the security features (profiles, remote wipe, etc) make that 95% of phones and any mail server.

They don't call it "crackberry" for nothing. The withdrawl symptoms are
similar.

We're not getting any calls on this at the moment and have users
spread across a variety of carriers including Verizon.   We have a
large group of users in the east and we're not seeing reports from
them.  Might be local to TN.

Through their NOC network wise and/or application wise?  I know it functions
with a customer site Exchange server and some application loaded on the
customer site as well.

Even BES services are still routed through RIM's NOC.  We're not seeing any reported outages in CHI, ATL, BOS, NYC areas, for BES service.
 Blackberries route all BES data over Rim's network and has a connection to your internal BES server(s).  The major difference is that BES offers
a much lower response time (push) and ability to sync Calendar and Contacts as opposed to the BIS service which I was under the impression was just a 15minute pop/imap refresh.  Not sure if BIS supports IMAPIDLE yet or not.  If it does then it'd be up to your email provider to support it as well to get a push like experience for email.
More than likely this is a BIS service issue.  I'm pretty sure RIM has the traffic separate to make sure that SLAs on data can be maintained
for priority customers.

RIM, of course, is *based in Canada*, which is why the Star had the first
official report.

It's been coming back in slowly since about 10 this morning EST; reported
time out was 0315, though I don't know whether that's -0500 or -0400.

@spetnik is covering it pretty well.

Cheers,

The last normally received email I got on my Verizon Blackberry was at 2:50
am (EST), so I think the 0315 time out would be -0500.

RIM, of course, is *based in Canada*, which is why the Star had the first
official report.

It's been coming back in slowly since about 10 this morning EST; reported
time out was 0315, though I don't know whether that's -0500 or -0400.

@spetnik is covering it pretty well.

Did anyone see their e-mail servers' IMAP session counts from RIM go down
during this outage?  I wonder if that's a reasonable proxy..

Verizon's 800# for blackberry service in Central FL  is stating it's a
blackberry outage, and several news outlets in Canada (of all places) are
reporting outages across North America:

I've had a couple of calls from customers asking if we are down (our email

The people who have called are on Verizon and are in the Chattanooga, TN

Yeah...they tweeted they're having network issues. It's affecting Slicehost, 37 signals and TechCrunch in that DC as well.

You've been misinformed.  :-)

BIS email is instant-push, just like BES: my average delay is about 4 seconds.

You don't get calendar and contact sync, though; they have to have *some*
way to sell BES server besides remote wipe (which you also don't get).

Cheers,

Actually he's correct. If you'll take a look at the BIS product docs at blackberry.com you will see that BIS-E does indeed poll non-preferred mail servers every 15 minutes. If mail is found, another poll is conducted 3 minutes later. This continues until no mail is found on the server, at which point the polling timer resets to 15 minutes. Of course, gmail, blackberry.net and other preferred providers act as true push (like BES), but pure BIS on a non-preferred mail server has a 15 minute poll.

BIS supports the IMAP "IDLE" command where the connection stays open and the
IMAP server notifies the client when a new message arrives. So presuming
that your mail server supports it (and most do now days), it's basically
true "push" email without the need to do any form of polling.

If your server doesn't support IDLE, then it uses polling as you've
described.

Agreed. Unfortunately one of the largest providers of hosted mail, NetSol, still won't support this. If any NetSol engineers are reading: your customers would appreciate this functionality.

He's only correct for BIS accounts that are set up to *poll* external
mail servers at all.  

For accounts on the BIS itself, ie "@vzw.blackberry.net", it's true push,
and for several reasons, that's the only way I configure my users.

You've obviously had more experience with BIS services than I. So, I'll default to you on that. I did use Sprint's
BIS service 2 years ago for a very short time.  I had the option of specifying a check time of no less that 15 minutes.
I have not bothered to keep up on BIS services as it's of no use to the company I work for.
But, if IMAPIDLE is all you need to call something push, then by all means call BIS a push service.
However it lacks a lot of the sync features and control that we get from our BES environment.
All of which you stated previously (Calendar and Contacts) along with a whole slew of logging and management
features that we get from having our devices managed by a BES environment.  Message delivery time may be
exactly the same.  One may be slower depending on a whole slew of factors outside of the device itself. If you experience a service quality above what blackberry has in their KB articles.  I would think that you are experiencing the upside of the BIS service.  But I wouldn't expect RIM to jump if you were experiencing delays of up to 15+ minutes.  I know from talking with RIM that they even expect a delay of up to 10 minutes from email server to device to be acceptable because of the different variables that can impact the delivery.  But, when I call them and tell them a group of users in an area are experiencing delays and I'm not seeing significant out of coverage messages in the log files.  They're quick to get me an answer as to who, what, where and why.
At the end of the day it's more about what is the preference for the Business.  If all you need is email then I would say BIS is plenty good enough.  Service response time may be completely the same from the user perception of it.

This issue appears to affect multiple carriers in North America. 
We have devices on t-mobile ATT and Verizon in 9 states which are all experiencing issues.  Our devices in the UK are functioning correctly.

I don't know if there's any truth to it, but I just heard a national
TV report that it may take 1-2 *days* to get this resolved.

AT&T in south west Ohio.  I saw "edge" was in lower lettering.  It may just

Our BES server had been showing no US-based devices synced since around
6pm.  That would cover all major carriers, and multiple regions.

However I've just checked it again and a small number of devices are now
syncing, so I'm not sure if that's a sign they are coming back of not.

I have 850 users on BES in CHI,ATL, NYC, HOU, SFO,LAX and SAC that are all experiencing an issue with BES services.
The initial problem started with the BIS service and then RIM noticed that the BES side of the NOC was also experiencing issues.
I don't have an exact time for the BIS failure start.  But, I know I saw emails on it fairly early today.  BES notifications didn't come out until
after the 18:33 EST area of time.
I'm waiting to get in on another call with them.  But as it stands they are saying it's not a 100% failure but service is severely 
degraded and they're working "all hands on deck" to get it resolved. They don't have an ETA as to the resolution.
At this point the talking points memo is about the best you'll get without signing a RIM NDA.

RIM says that service has been restored for all of North America.  So, all users should start to see data flow again to their devices.
They didn't give any idea on which regions of North America would be picking up the quickest.  More likely it'll be based on 
service provider, email servers, device reception and lastly if you live in Canada or not.

What we have here is a failure to listen.

Each carrier will assign you one (or more) "native" BIS mailboxes, within
the blackberry.net domain, and attach them to your phone.

Mail sent to those mailboxes will be delivered by the same "true push" 
protocol used on BES setups, as that's what BIS really is: it's a big-ass 
BES cluster.

BIS customers can also configure IMAP pickup from off-net mailboxes, and I 
don't know whether that's proxied by BIS and pushed to the phone, or polled
directly, cause we don't use that.

That may or may not support IMAP IDLE.

Cheers,
-- jra

You make a good point here: My phone had NXTL -- all *links* were working; the problem was TCP 
carriage further back in the network somewhere.  Batterypull, re-register, and Master Radio
Reset all failed to help.

Voice and MMS were working, but nothing else.

Which, on reflection, is odd, since MMS requires HTTP.

MMS uses your carriers network.  Totally irrelevant of the Blackberry
network.

For data (browser/data using apps) it goes phone -> carrier network -> RIM
network -> www.google.com

Agreed. BIS consumers can set up one carrier.blackberry.net account, which is pushed like BES, without the IT policy and without the ability to set up that account as an Exchange account. 

The problem for BIS users who work for small companies that can't justify internal BES, and elect to not pay an extra $15 per month per device to the carrier in addition to approx $15 per month per device for a hosted BES (10 users = additional $300 per month), is they are reliant on BIS polling and pushing every 15, per RIM's KBs and my experience. So you end up in a situation where you're forwarding work addresses to blackberry.net addresses, essentially spoofing the "from" line, and getting true push that way. Of course, if BIS crashes every 5 days you're stuck.

What we have here is a failure to listen.

Each carrier will assign you one (or more) "native" BIS mailboxes, within
the blackberry.net domain, and attach them to your phone.

Mail sent to those mailboxes will be delivered by the same "true push" 
protocol used on BES setups, as that's what BIS really is: it's a big-ass 
BES cluster.

BIS customers can also configure IMAP pickup from off-net mailboxes, and I 
don't know whether that's proxied by BIS and pushed to the phone, or polled
directly, cause we don't use that.

That may or may not support IMAP IDLE.

Cheers,

Interesting - on what carrier? We had an outage in the Metro Vancouver
area on Rogers.

Message-ID: <89258bd40912231708v2d410508g7d1a9009a71eb9a0@mail.gmail.com>

Seeing problems trying to reach amazon.com. Looks like the ultradns
name servers aren't responding? at least from here, and other external
dns servers I query can't seem to resolve amazon either.

Friend of mine still has some of their DNS in cache, and hardcoding
dns in my hosts file allows me to hit Amazon without any issue. I was
surfing fine until my DNS flushed and couldn't re-resolve.

Anyone else seeing anything fun?

Looks like they might be coming back online - my trace is actually
making it to them now, sort of.

I can confirm there's some sort of outage going on - my current client
site is not publicly resolvable at the moment.

It looks like this is a West coast issue - resolving via DNS servers
on the East coast does in fact return DNS for Amazon.

Sounds like theres some murmur on nanog about this too.

It looks like this is a West coast issue - resolving via DNS servers
on the East coast does in fact return DNS for Amazon.

Sounds like theres some murmur on nanog about this too.

When I tried to go to amazon.com about 30 mins ago (probably a few minutes
before your mail) I got an error.  A (possibly undeserved) curse at Comcast
and a few reloads later and it started working again.

However I'm now seeing :

Non-authoritative answer:
www.amazon.com  nameserver = ns-911.amazon.com

ns-911.amazon.com       internet address = 207.171.178.13

Which may imply something unusual is going on...

So I guess this means they can't claim they don't have outages?

Actually, no.  Given some folks indicated they weren't having issues, I suspect their use of anycast did what it was supposed to do in the face of a massive D(D)oS -- limit the damage to the network topologically nearest transmitting nodes.  Of course, I have no real details...

Meh, technicality. It acts like an outage to the geographic area 
affected, and it should be considered as such.

Perhaps, however I'm sure their marketing folks will be happy to use the technicality to justify their 100% uptime claims (like every other anycast DNS provider)...

If I have to explain the event in person to a client CEO whose site
was down - and I did - then it's an outage.

If we're wonking about what happened here - which we are - it's a failure.

Not all failures are outages.  But this was an outage.

One cannot ignore the reality of marketing-speak to come.  But we
don't have to indulge it on operational lists.
