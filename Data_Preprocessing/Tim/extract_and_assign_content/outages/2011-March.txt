FYI For the last few months Qwest ATM services are at or beyond capacity in
and out of Eastern Oregon. Ridiculously slow at times or just completely
times out. But  I don?t know if this has anything to do with Qwest in Boise.
DSL customers here are not happy. ETR is MAY 2011. Coincidently the Century
Link merger is final in April 2011. So it?s hard to say the ETR will be on
time.

Just because it's a ring doesn't mean it was configured for protection...

That defies every common understanding of "SONET ring".  Better to call it
"linear STS connection" then. =)

Not really...

A SONET Ring can provision circuits with or without a protect path. Circuits
which are built with a protect path are not affected by a single cut. Circuits
which are built without a protect path can be affected by a single cut, but,
leave the other side of the ring available to other circuits.

It's not uncommon for a carrier to (and quite reasonably so) charge more
for a protected circuit.

This configuration can be done on a per-circuit basis. The SONET itself
is still a ring, whether any particular circuit on that ring is groomed for
protection or not.

While you're technically correct, it's not how it's commonly implemented.
Well, maybe it's more common than I was aware. =)  It's not how regional and
state fiber networks in our neck of the woods do it.

Not really...

A SONET Ring can provision circuits with or without a protect path. Circuits
which are built with a protect path are not affected by a single cut.
Circuits
which are built without a protect path can be affected by a single cut, but,
leave the other side of the ring available to other circuits.

It's not uncommon for a carrier to (and quite reasonably so) charge more
for a protected circuit.

This configuration can be done on a per-circuit basis. The SONET itself
is still a ring, whether any particular circuit on that ring is groomed for
protection or not.

Concur.  If a customer buys a "ring" they expect a ring.  Protection is
implied.  If they buy a point-to-point, that is a different story.  A
protected point-to-point might be provisioned on a ring or it might be
provisioned with two separate point-to-point circuits.

A "SONET ring failure" would require two faults.  That said, I have seen
cases where both sides of the ring enter a building by the same trench
allowing one case of backhoe fade to take out the entire building.

I'm sorry to be a kvetch, but it seems to me that a simple outage 
notification on the "Outages" list has turned into a colloquium on SONET 
failure modes.  If I should be in a different venue please flame away, but 
the SNR here for "Outages" lately is sometimes as bad as NANOG.

Thanks, Ken, for reminding me that discussions should go to
outages-discussion.  This is the last post on this issue until Jason gives
us a status update or that it's fixed.

Anyone know what is going on with Cogent this morning? I can't reach

to InternetPulse, they've got some major packet loss between them and

Wow, I wake up to quite the storm.  Outage was restored early Saturday 
afternoon.  I was relaying what was told to me, which was not very 
much.  I was fishing to see if anyone else was affected.  I'll be 
looking for an RFO.

No RFO but we were having the same issues - appears to have cleared up now.

Anyone know what is going on with Cogent this morning? I can't reach certain destinations through them via Verizon (old alternet). According to InternetPulse, they've got some major packet loss between them and
Level3 and Verizon.

english.aljazeera.net appears to have some form of RR set up, since
the IP addresses everyone is getting back for it vary greatly.  "dig
any" doesn't help here, but the A record TTL is quite low (something
like 180 seconds).

>> An HTTP error occurred while getting:
>> http://english.aljazeera.net/
>> Details: "connect timed out to /86.62.248.78:80".

Example:

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;english.aljazeera.net.         IN      A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
english.aljazeera.net.  752     IN      CNAME english.aljazeerait.net.c.itmdb.net.
english.aljazeerait.net.c.itmdb.net. 83 IN A    206.33.63.124

So let's do an actual real test:

$ curl -v -i -s -S -H "Host: english.aljazeera.net" http://86.62.248.78:80/
* About to connect() to 86.62.248.78 port 80 (#0)
*   Trying 86.62.248.78...

So, that server/whatever in the RR list is obviously busted, or the
network surrounding it is.

The outage here Boise was caused by a core router failure in the Boise CO during maintenance, or so Qwest claims. I suspect the maintenance corrupted the routing tables from the behavior we saw (some parts of the Internet accessible, others not).

It took a week, but it's now fixed.  I reached out (repeatedly) to both Turner and XO, and one of those two likely fixed it.  Something between hop 7 and 8 was likely the culprit.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimnRCyHQ3eVF9o6uuyrsT68SupbWA-TiCQv1joq@mail.gmail.com>

We've been observing a small about of intermittent packet loss to/from
AT&T and Level3 here in the San Francisco Bay Area this morning. In
examining the situation, it seems like a evenly-spaced dropping of
packets to certain IPs.

This appears to end users like some IPs on destination networks are
reachable, while some adjacent ones are not.

I suspect this is due to a failed LAG leg or ECMP leg on Level3's side.


We were able to route around the problem for now.

Cheers,
jof

-------------------
We experienced similar issue last week off our level3 connection for a 
specific /21 customer block. After further troubleshooting we decided to 
re-route our /21 to the other provider where packet loss issue went 
away. We are still scratching our heads over this issue.

Have you seen this issue with any other carriers? We have seen a *very*
similar issue with several Comcast-announced routes in the Midwest and
we've never been able to track it down to any "for sure" type of
problem.

Level3 is reporting that it may be an issue with a core switch experiencing

Hrm. That's been my solution for this type of problem as well: just
temporarily switch providers in both directions. This can be a little
tricker if course if you're not a directly-downstream customer of the
affected transit AS.

I've been able to identify this problem by running mtr or traceroute
simultaneously to several (at least 16+) IPs that are adjacent in a
remote network and seeing different source IPs coming back for the
ICMP type 11/code 0 (TTL Exceeded in transit) responses, and
correlating loss to some subset of those IPs. Of course control plane
policing or loaded CPUs on remote routers can confound these numbers.

I feel like MTR does this especially well.

Hope that helps. Good luck. Enjoy your routers.

According to Level 3


They have routed traffic from the problem module in the switch, and high
CPU utilization has dropped. They are currently checking with their
customers to confirm improvement.

Got a couple of VPNs and using different ISPs to Australia from the UK and
they are struggling at the moment.

Seems to be as soon as we hit Asianetcom.net looking at the traceroutes, the
San Jose link is very much worse than the the LAX connections.

Could be as a result of the events off the japanese coast I would suggest
but if anyone has anymore info would be appreciated

There are waves on pacnet from japan to taiwan down, and circuits
from san jose past japan to india that are down, with timeframes that
are consistent with quake or aftershock related impacts; no guarantee
that's the actual cause, mind you.

Out of curiosity, has anyone compiled a list of cables (or landing stations) that were damaged by the earthquake?

I can confirm JUS (both North and South) are impacted with no ETA for repair.

If anyone has additional details on specific cable systems or landing stations impacted it would helpful.

Message-ID: <CDEB3A6A-D459-4507-A8F5-E9A0D39F0325@voxeo.com>

Folks,

Anyone aware of what's going on with Dreamhost?  There is apparently an outage there but no updates on their Twitter feed or other status site.  Can't get to http://www.dreamhost.com/ from where I'm at on the network.

I ask because the CrisisCommons wiki on the Japan Quake is hosted there and volunteers can't access it:
http://wik?i.crisisco?mmons.org/?wiki/Honsh?u_Quake

(And per Twitter, it seems that Dreamhost sites are unavailable from much of the Internet.)

See http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/

That server seems overloaded, but when it responds, its last update
(2 hrs ago) says:

	Update 7:11 am: We are currently operating on half of a
	core, so partial connectivity has been restored. We are
	working to resolve an issue with one of the cisco core
	supervisors not maintaining it's configuration. Systems

Network outage
Posted (March 14th, 2011 at 2:20 am PST) by patrickm
We apologize for the downtime as our core network is offline at the 
moment. Our network admin is addressing the issue and we expect service to 
resume shortly. This will prevent access to the customer web panel.

Update: This issue is now resolved!  This was due to network maintenance 
which was not supposed to have any effect on connectivity, but sadly did. 
We are investigating this more thoroughly and if we have any additional 
info to provide, it will be posted here!  Thanks for  your patience with 
this outage.  Please contact Support if you are still experiencing any 
issues.

Update 5:41 am (Pacific): We apologize, as we are experiencing another 
outage.  Our network admin is working on the issue at this time and we 
expect it to be resolved shortly.  This outage will affect core services 
such as the Web Panel and WebMail.  We will update this post as soon as we 
have more information or when the issue is resolved!

Update 7:11 am: We are currently operating on half of a core, so partial 
connectivity has been restored. We are working to resolve an issue with 
one of the cisco core supervisors not maintaining it?s configuration.

I suppose I should have just posted this. The Status page loads for
me, albeit slowly. It is probably getting hammered by customers asking
the same questions.

It took a minute to load for me on ATT Uverse in IL.
Top update is as follows:
We apologize for the downtime as our core network is offline at the moment. Our network admin is addressing the issue and we expect service to resume shortly. This will prevent access to the customer web panel.

Update: This issue is now resolved! This was due to network maintenance which was not supposed to have any effect on connectivity, but sadly did. We are investigating this more thoroughly and if we have any additional info to provide, it will be posted here! Thanks for your patience with this outage. Please contact Support if you are still experiencing any issues.

Update 5:41 am (Pacific): We apologize, as we are experiencing another outage. Our network admin is working on the issue at this time and we expect it to be resolved shortly. This outage will affect core services such as the Web Panel and WebMail. We will update this post as soon as we have more information or when the issue is resolved!

Update 7:11 am: We are currently operating on half of a core, so partial connectivity has been restored. We are working to resolve an issue with one of the cisco core supervisors not maintaining it?s configuration. Systems that are affected by this are our servers located at our downtown Los Angels, CA location (including the panel)? servers at our LAX data center are not affected by this outage.

Their status paged loaded for me, but its painfully slow. The last post from
today is talking about a partial core outage relating to a failed
supervisor.

I got to the status page very slowly, missing all formatting/CSS, but it
says:

Can you be more specific as to the nature of the issues?
There was a fairly significant outage at LINX last night, but this has 
now been resolved.

No more details I'm afraid. Very temperamental internet connection from
several of our locations to various sites across the net. Sites up and
down.

Issue confirmed by Rackspace (at ISP level):

Correct, we've seen significant issues with BT specifically; to the 
point that we've shutdown peering with them.  So far this has resolved 
most of the reported problems.

They have an update of 6am CST saying it's resolved, but nothing 
indicating who was having the issue.
None of our customers phoned in with issues, and we didn't notice 
anything ourselves.
Also nothing on El Reg or /.

Is there a good resource that follows the various cable systems and their
current status?  I'm interested generally and also in the specific status of
JUS.  Is that maintained by Reach?

Thanks,

-Chris

Sorry to post here, but it seemed like a relevant list.

I'm having trouble finding authoritative info on which cable systems were damaged, cut, disabled, powered down, or otherwise not 100% operations due to the earthquake / tsunami near Japan.

Anyone know which ones are up or down, and ETR?

Global Crossing stopped passing ESP packets from Sudden Link customers
last Thursday night. Sudden Link realized they have an issue 
on hand about 26 hours ago after many customers called with VPN

Victor,

Thank you for the info. I'm assuming you are in the SF Bay area?
I ask because we have a site in SF that is pretty much on dial-up speeds 
with anything that has to hop routes involving Global Crossing.

I?ve been in contact with an internal Comcast contact, but it would be
helpful if others could confirm or deny that web page loads of
ipv6.comcast.com are slow (yes, you'll need IPv6 access to test -- and yes,
I have native, non-tunneled access).  I?ve measured load times of 1.5 to 2.5
minutes.  There?s two AAAA records, so you many need to use wget to be aware
of which one you're hitting.

The issue started around 3:10 pm Central.  The other 10 IPv6 sites I monitor
aren't having issues.

However, this affects each element and each redirect. There are about 4 redirects between

the page once you get there, so, it takes a LONG time to get to the point of seeing anything

Thanks, everyone.  Jason B's last e-mail to me (sent after I sent a note to
outages) confirmed that it was not a "just me" issue and that Comcast staff
are actively working on it.

I?ve been in contact with an internal Comcast contact, but it would be
helpful if others could confirm or deny that web page loads of
ipv6.comcast.com are slow (yes, you'll need IPv6 access to test -- and yes,
I have native, non-tunneled access).  I?ve measured load times of 1.5 to 2.5
minutes.  There?s two AAAA records, so you many need to use wget to be aware
of which one you're hitting.

The issue started around 3:10 pm Central.  The other 10 IPv6 sites I monitor
aren't having issues.

Anyone seeing issues in this last week (and continuing periodically)

times were servers gave 500 errors, email servers wouldn't respond and
more ... all from a variety of locations and different users/Internet

Yes. More and more frequent lately. So unreliable that we're going

On that note I have an ISP account and several businesses with Apps.  No
complaints.

The errors I saw were from our own business edition.

I find I have trouble every day or two with the google logins
when I'm logged into several accounts at the same time.  The
verification redirects fail in various stupid ways and the only
solution I have found is to go to http://google.com/ and log out
? which erases the cookie and logs you out of all your accounts
at once.

Then I relog into all my accounts in the right order (seriously,
it has to be by login order? it can't be by account name?  You
can't bookmark the right account unless you login in the right
order?)

Then a day or two later it fails in some novel way and I have to
log out and relog all my accounts ? again ?

? and again ?

? and again ?

I keep hoping they'll get their shit together with the multiple
login cookies eventually, but it's been like a year, so I just
use the workaround.

Perhaps it's something like that?

I have seen it almost daily on some users, and never see it on others. 


It's all part of Google's restructuring, and is much more browser related 
than it is an outage. For instance, I very seldom see a problem with 
chrome or IE users, and see it very often with Firefox and Safari users.

I think the outages list is probably the last place to ask that question =P

I have been extremely pleased.  Is there anything you'd like to know outside

I thought everyone was well aware of this issue by now, as it's existed for
a long time; you can read many articles about it by doing a quick search:

Hey there,

 

 

Did you mean TWC/Road Runner?  I don't see Comcast in your traceroute
below, but tbone.rr.com is Time Warner Cable's backbone (not Comcast).

At first I was getting connection resets.  18 minutes ago:

"We?re sorry, the Netflix website and the ability to instantly watch
movies are both temporarily unavailable."

I don't have a quote but it went on to stress DVD shipping operations
were still up and running.  Now the shipping is down as well:

"We are sorry, the Netflix website and our DVD shipping operations are
temporarily down.
Our engineers are working hard to bring the site and shipping
operations back up as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience
and, again, we apologize for the inconvenience. If you need further
assistance, please call us at 1-877-445-6064."

Thanks for the confirmation and report it started hours earlier.
They've changed the error message to a third variant now, not
mentioning the DVD shipping at all (which is what I would have
expected from the beginning, really):

"We are sorry, the Netflix website and the ability to instantly watch
movies are both temporarily unavailable.
Our engineers are working hard to bring the site and ability to watch
instantly back up as soon as possible. We appreciate your patience
and, again, we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If you

It sounds global, but I note I'm coming from a Clearwire 4G connection
near Seattle (the IPv4 address of clear.davehart.net).
