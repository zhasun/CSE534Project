We have a DS3 outage on A MPLS circuit, and I'm hearing there was a 
railway fire affecting 600 feet of fiber between NYC and Philly.

Anyone else here anything about this?

Thanks,

Jason

Theoretical response time limits of Ping

So, if we assume that a ?ping? travels with the speed of light, which
are the best possible response times we can get?

10 km -> 0,067 milliseconds
100 km -> 0,67 milliseconds
1,000 km -> 6,7 milliseconds
10,000 km -> 67 milliseconds

(Note that Ping shows the time for a roundtrip, i.e. 2 x the distance.)
Pinging between Europe and USA

The distance between New York and Paris is 5,839 km. For light to travel
from New York to Paris and then back again would take 40 milliseconds.

Maximum distance between two places on Earth

If you choose the shortest route, the maximum distance between two
locations will never be more than halfway around the planet. Halfway
around Earth is about 20,000 km.

Considering that Ping goes to a destination and then back again, the
packet sent by Ping would travel 40,000 km, the equivalent of a trip
around Earth.

That is 133 milliseconds.

Anyone who has tried to ping various servers across the world will know
that this is a way better response time than what you can realistically
get. So why is ping so slow?

Why Ping is slower in the real world

The examples above take place under ideal conditions that don?t exist in
the real world.

   1. The actual distance traveled will be longer, more like zig zag
than a straight line.
   2. Repeaters, switches and routers will slow down transfer speeds.
The more equipment the signal has to pass through (for example routers),
the longer it will take to reach its target.
   3. The actual speed of the signal will never quite match the speed of
light. Even with fiber optics (glass) the speed of light is about 30%
slower than through vacuum or air, and most of the distance covered will
be through fiber.
   4. A beam of light bounces around like a pinball when it travels
along the thin (admittedly extremely thin) fiber, and that will of
course make the distance traveled even longer.

With all this in mind, you should probably double the ?ideal? response
times shown above for a more realistic target to aim at. It?s useful to
know when there is room to push for better network performance, and when
the actual physical limits set in.

Let us add analog and digital times:

My DSL-modem says 1 Meg uplink, 5 Meg downlink. Real speed is slower but
that is mostly artificial.

My router needs to assemble a complete packet before routing.

uplink   1480 bits 0.676 milliseconds
downlink 1480 bits 0.135 milliseconds

The DSLAM side should not add to this timing because it is the same
analog circuit. But my own switch should add 0.067 milliseconds for
10 Meg or 0.006 milliseconds for 100 Meg ports

Here is traceroute

traceroute iason.site.voila.fr
traceroute to star.site.voila.fr.wanadoo.fr (193.252.158.3), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets

  1  krzach.peter-dambier.de (192.168.48.2)  3 ms  2 ms  2 ms

my router and workstation add above the expected 0.9 ms

  2  * * *

DSLAM does not ICMP?

  3  217.0.81.118 (217.0.81.118)  46 ms (ttl=252!)  48 ms (ttl=252!)  47 ms (ttl=252!)

more than 1000 kilometers? I guess it should be some 160 kilometers over there and back.

  4  f-eb7.F.DE.net.DTAG.DE (62.154.16.222)  49 ms (ttl=250!)
     f-eb7.F.DE.net.DTAG.DE (62.154.16.218)  50 ms (ttl=250!)
     f-eb7.F.DE.net.DTAG.DE (62.154.16.222)  49 ms (ttl=250!)

  5  * * *
  6  * * *

  7  po6-0.ntaub201.Aubervilliers.francetelecom.net (193.251.126.153)  212 ms  202 ms  166 ms

That suggests a link via a geosyncronous satellite (72 000 kilometers including return path) :)


Well looking up routing tables in memory does take time.
Interleaving packets to stabilize medium speed for VoIP might
add another constant.

Both (3) and (4) are rather big routers with big tables.

Maybe I should get and try paris traceroute.

Local news in Philly isn't reporting anything of the kind. I have a number of circuits terminating in the philly area and all are up and running. If there is a fire, let's hope its not like that tunnel fire they had around DC 5 or 6 years ago.

We had an XO T1 in Philly down for a few hours Saturday due to a "fiber
cut", but we know how everyone uses that general term.  Circuit was back up
at some point yesterday.

Yes - apparently this was affecting XO as well.  Mine dropped Friday at 
8:45PM and restored almost 24 hours later.

If this was indeed a railway fire (I can't find any news supporting that), 
I thought we all learned a lesson in 01 after the Howard tunnel fire.

AP - Internet Fails in 5 Latin Countries - Thursday June 21, 6:31 pm ET
Ruptured Cable Disrupts Internet Service in 5 Latin American Nations

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Accidental damage to an undersea fiber-optics
cable left millions of people without Internet service in five Latin
American countries, the cable's owner said Thursday.

In Colombia, as many as 45 percent of Internet users were left with
limited or no connection. Problems were also reported in Panama,
Venezuela, Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

In a statement, Columbus said repair ships set sail from Mexico and
the company hoped the cable would be fixed on Friday.

The statement did not say what damaged the underwater cable. The company
said it would investigate the cause.

The general secretary of the Colombian phone company, Empresa Telefonica
de Bogota, Andres Perez, told The Associated Press that nearly half of
this South American country's 5 million Internet users were left without
service.

The Nicaraguan Internet service-provider Cablenet said a backup system
kicked in after the cable's rupture delivering limited but slower service.

Costa Rica's state-run Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad also
reported a slowing down of Internet service.

It is the second problem to befall the Arcos network this month. On June
5, a cable off the coast of Venezuela was cut causing no interruption to
service.

Subject: [Outages] Charter Fiber Cut
Message-ID: <56907.192.168.1.12.1182648621.squirrel@192.168.1.12>

Appears to be a rather major NW outage for charter communications
customers (business, and residential cable internet) because of a cut
fiber line in Oregon.

The info I have from charter NOC says no ETA on fix, but they are aware.
Traffic coming from Oregon "has been rerouted, but we are unable to
redirect the Washington Traffic"
