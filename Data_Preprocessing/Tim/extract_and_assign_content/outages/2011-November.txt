Subject: [outages] Intermittent Connectivity to Amazon S3 via Cogent at
	Qwest interconnect
Message-ID: <CADE4tYUn+TTf7AfjTPW5d-Thzkawdi+t_s1HKsG+NH-9jsCyTA@mail.gmail.com>

It appears the there is a connectivity issue between Cogent and Qwest
causing intermittent connectivity to Amazon S3's East Coast endpoint
(appears to be dying in Arlington, VA). Can anyone else on Cogent confirm?

Subject: [outages] SF Bay: Comcast/TATA issue or GBLX/nLayer issue?
Message-ID: <20111103223638.GA2374@icarus.home.lan>

Not sure when this started, could have been going on for hours.  I just
got in to work and attempted to RDP into my home machine -- no go.

The asymmetric nature of routing makes this a little difficult to
determine where the actual loss is, but I imagine what's shown in WinMTR
is correct -- ingress packets are (were, keep reading) getting lost at
some point.  Note in the ingress mtr the Worst field.  Also note that on
the ingress side, packets were going from San Jose->Atlanta->Fort
Worth->Los Angeles.

I can't tell if this was a Comcast<->TATA Communications problem, or if
it was a GBLX<->nLayer issue.  I'm inclined to believe the latter.

And as usual these days, the instant I begin writing about the problem,
it stops.  Whatever this was, however, was pretty major.  I wish I had a
start time.  End time was approximately 15:28 PDT.  I have not checked
BGPlay to look for routing/reconvergence.

I know customers on Time Warner Cable's fiber and cable (coax) service
had problems from about 9:05 to 9:20 EST this morning.  Had anyone
else seen issues?

I wonder if other ISP's were effected, such as CenturyLink (a customer
that contracted me has this as a backup, another primarily).

Hello --

Our Irvine DC level3 circuit just took a hit, apparently level3 suffered
a regional backbone routing issue losing multiple adjacency off its

Did anyone noticed any issues off their level3 peer(s) routes?

I think Level 3 just had a major burp in the NY area.

Both ASN 20208 and ASN 11579 were dead in the water from about 9:12am - 
9:19am EST.

These are the paths in question:

20208 12271 7843 3356
11579 3356

Just a heads up ...

We received the following from our email gateway vendor:

	connectivity issues today.  This may cause unusual challenges

Hadn't seen this here yet.  Apologies if it's out of place.

"There were widespread Internet outages and slowdowns on Monday after backbone provider Level3 Communications had a major outage, affecting some downstream providers and enterprises. The company has not put out a statement regarding the incident, but it does not appear right now as if there was an attack involved."

We received one report from an ISP customer that they couldn't VPN to a site
with a Frontier Communications IP, and two reports from Knology customers
about connectivity issues to the Internet.  Makes you wonder if there is a
broader issue going on.

Sorry that we don't have any more details -- these are small-biz customers

My home internet connection (TWC Coax) was impacted this morning at
about the same time you indicate.

There is a thread on NANOG discussing[1].  As someone else already
replied, looks like a Level3 issue.

Witnessed an outage at 8 CST from upstream.

Sounded like someone was broadcasting a BGP route with an invalid attribute and caused BGP session restarts or Core Dumps/crashes on any Juniper router running version 10.4

I know customers on Time Warner Cable's fiber and cable (coax) service
had problems from about 9:05 to 9:20 EST this morning.  Had anyone
else seen issues?

I wonder if other ISP's were effected, such as CenturyLink (a customer
that contracted me has this as a backup, another primarily).

Hello --

Our Irvine DC level3 circuit just took a hit, apparently level3 suffered
a regional backbone routing issue losing multiple adjacency off its
is-is domain.

Did anyone noticed any issues off their level3 peer(s) routes?

We had an interesting issue with AS209. When the Level(3) problem
occurred, our BGP session with them started hold time expiring every 2
- 10 minutes, and horrendous packet loss to our advertised prefix.

Finally got a human around 1830 UTC with access to their router, he
claimed he did nothing yet it conveniently fixed itself after we
received cease from their end. Now they're blaming local loop even
though we saw 0% loss when sourcing pings from the interface IP
assigned by them.

The weather's quite bad on the backbone today; the most prominent rumor 
has to do with Junos 10.mumble dumping core all over the place; see NANOG
for much more than we've had this morning.

Jared was apparently having trouble with the mailman instance at puck that
delivers the outages lists, as well as dc-ops and some other lists; he's just
cleared it up, and you will probably see a bunch of this morning's mail.

Message-ID: <9DE0B86D-0663-4A96-83B7-28A07A31F773@puck.nether.net>

Some of you may have noticed that the list was slow today.  This has been corrected, but was a result of some broken mailman configuration.  I recently updated the software and my speed patches were not properly applied.  This has been corrected.

Sorry about this.  It impacted all lists hosted here.

We are also upgrading the hardware in the next month or so, hopefully that also helps with the troubles.  It will certainly help me as I can finally get upgraded to an OS that supports most modern hardware.

Thanks,

- Jared

Likely, it's the Great Juniper Outage of 2011, which has been being
covered mostly on NANOG all morning, cause Outages had indigestion. 

Routers dumping core, root cause not yet specified; known to have affected
Level3, and TWTelecom, among other backbone carriers.

We saw this earlier, specifically with trying to resolve
us.srp.blackberry.com against RIMs name servers in the same segment.

We were told that Level 3 was having issues, and that they were
resolved before 12:00 PM ET.

The Register is reporting that Time Warner, Level3, etc. were (are?) the victims of "a bug in Juniper routers that corrupted BGP...tables."

Hadn't seen this here yet.  Apologies if it's out of place.

"There were widespread Internet outages and slowdowns on Monday after backbone provider Level3 Communications had a major outage, affecting some downstream providers and enterprises. The company has not put out a statement regarding the incident, but it does not appear right now as if there was an attack involved."

There have been some reports from various now-scrambling ISPs and NSPs
about their Juniper JunOS devices rebooting.

Apparently, it may be related to the (either accidental or
intentional) exploitation of this bug: http://pastebin.com/HBWiH92j

>From the reports of those networks having problems, it's interesting
to hear who's running Juniper and MXes.

<tangential sidenote>
It's too bad that Junipers bugs aren't listed publicly. For clueful
network operations, having this information available to them could
have enabled them to properly weigh the risk of evaluating and
certifying versions of their operating systems.

Cheers,
jof

Hello --

Apparently upgrade to mailman in the past week may have caused one of
the patches to go wild causing outgoing queue sluggishness while making
its way out.

This has been fixed hoping this will flush the backlog.

Thanks for your patience.

It is reported to be a known issue for which Juniper issued a PSN 3
months ago.  If that's the case, you can't really blame Juniper when
they tell people "here's a bug, you should upgrade", and some don't heed
their advice (especially when you are paying for that advice).

Well, you have to have support to get a fixed JUNOS, and if you have
support, you can subscribe to notifications about new PSNs (based on
device, OS, etc.).  I get email about PSNs relevant to my hardware and
software, and I go read them to see if the apply to my specific setup.

Am I wrong in thinking that not all PSNs are public, even to
contract-holding customers

There have been times in interacting with their sales engineering
group and JTAC, who have sent me bug details that were not locatable
when searching their PSN database.

I have a feeling that PSNs are only noted and released to customers
once there's a fix for a problem.

This is getting off-topic somewhat, so I suggest we leave this thread
be to keep the signal-to-noise ratio high.
There's more in-depth discussion taking place on NANOG.

Cheers,
jof

It looks like Bandwidth.com is having another voice outage.
Our outbound phone calls go to their system, and appear connected from
our side, but Bandwidth.com side wont ring for about 2-5 minutes.
Seemingly getting connected at Bandwidth.com but not making a
successful dial tone to any POTS providers.
Multiple sites seem to be having this problem.

The Bandwidth.com call center is offline as well, getting either a
disconnected message, or the number simply will not ring (from
cellphones and landlines)

Do you know if you are using their Core2 network or their legacy network?

Not noticing any issues here in Denver sending calls to the Denver and
Atlanta servers in a round robin. No customer complaints either - yet....

My NYC clients who use bandwidth.com ring 4-5 times then go to reorder 
--> they're having an outage.

I saw issues earlier this week when I was doing traceroutes to their NYC
wholesale and DFW wholesale switches. I was going via XO and seeing lots of
packetloss. I moved the outbound traffic to a provider that got to them via
Cogent and things cleared up instantly.

Greetings,

Did anyone notice a 2-5 min minor hit on Level 3 or other carriers around 10:15-10:25? We saw two spikes in bgp updates coming from Level 3 and lost monitoring momentarily. Doesn't seem to have impacted much, but I was curious if anyone saw anything.

Thanks,
Preston

Message-ID: <4EBAF831.1080204@netwurx.net>

As of 3:15 CST We are seeing ~15% packet loss on 2 TWC MetroE circuits 
in Wisconsin and lost our BGP transit session in Milwaukee.
I'm still on hold but the TWC guy said he was hearing a lot of calls 
coming in from Wisconsin starting around that time.

I've held back for a while now...    Please define IP problems?   How about
a mtr or some sort, diag or examples.    East coast?  Central? Mountain?
West-Side? Level3? TWTC? Quest? ATT? XO?

I think Frank can pipe up with more questions and what not...

Yup; Intellectual Property was a *really* bad idea, and patents, copyrights and
trademarks should all be abolished immediately.

But that's not important now.

If you tell us what kind of problem you're seeing, down whose link to where, we
might have some more information for you...

I don't have any details.  Still trying to figure out what the problem is.
We aren't getting complaints of not being able to connect to our network by
our customers, but we are seeing a lot of problems between us and our
upstream ITSP vendors.  Our ITSP vendors also seem to be having a lot of
problems with call setups.

First, be careful about forwarding internal mail out to mailing lists; you
can leak things that way which people might prefer you didn't.

Second, if XO is involved, you should see this week's NANOG archive, wherein
we discuss the fact that XO has been known to put in blocks down to the 
IP/port level without notice; it's possible that might have some bearing on 
your problems.  This was specifically mentioned in the context of SIP.

I'd like to remind everyone of -- and encourage you to read, if you haven't 
lately -- my two favorite essays on how to get help from the Internet:

The first is "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Raymond and Rick
Moen:

  http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

and the second is PuTTY author Simon Tatham's "How To Report Bugs Effectively":

  http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html

The short version is: people on the Internet help you for free.  Remember that,
and do your homework first, so that they don't make fun of you for sport 
instead.  :-)

Shortly after 6AM EST there was an interruption between Level 3 and
TWC.  Backup circuits couldn't handle the load.  I was unable to reach
4.2.2.2 and a number of other Level 3 specific IPs (voice switches on
Level 3's network in Atlanta, Cincinnati).  Service effecting OpenDNS
as well (208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220)

Seems to have cleared up just a moment ago.

After a couple more bits o'tuning today, propagation delay through the 
outages mailing lists has been cut further now to about 10 minutes, from the
2-6 hours we saw last week.

Thanks to Jared Mauch, who hosts these lists for us (along with quite a number
of others) for free as a service to the Internetworking community.

Jared has a hardware upgrade schedules for puck sometime in the next month or
so, which should improve things further for all the services he hosts. 

<hat type="moderator" action="remove">
I plan to paypal him a couple bucks, to help out with the costs he incurs,

I'm seeing Twitter, when I click on my Mentions link tonight, jump to
"I'm sorry; that user doesn't exist!"

Clearly, something's wrong.  :-)

People on my follow list, which I *can* still reliably load, are speculating
that this might be related to the continuing rollout out "Activities" ("Dude;
we know how much you like to twitter, so we put a twitter in the corner of 
your twitter so you can twitter while you twitter!" :-)

Corroboration and explanations welcome.  Everything else goes to -discuss.

Seeing some odd routing and packet loss from UK->Australia around the
Singtel relays as you go across from LAX.

also this shows singtel problems for while (so not sure accurate this is)

http://www.internettrafficreport.com/asia.htm

Been since around midnight GMT but oddly works fine for 1 subnet and
problematic for another on the same AS in Australia (AS12477)

The ITR isn't well maintained, so there's lots of zeroes for things there
shouldn't be.

 

Can you share some traceroutes and/or mtr output?

Not seeing any problems (Denver, CO with Cogent and L3) - and checking

nothing looks out of the ordinary....

we're seeing it drop, but ymmv of course.

I am working on upgrading the hardware of the host that hosts this list.  I believe I have a comprehensive list of tasks that run on this host that I will be using to migrate the services, but wanted to warn people that the host will be undergoing work in the coming week.

This is not only a hardware but an OS change as well, so a fairly large project to undertake.

If you have questions, please direct them off-list.  This should be a nice upgrade in performance across the board.

Without saying which ISPs, which locations, and which destinations
you're having trouble with, your message is useless.  Your question
seems to suggest you think these multiple ISPs are each connecting you
to one big backbone in the sky, and you think this unified backbone
might have a backache today.  There is no unified backbone.  There are
many different national and global networks that can credibly talk
about their backbones, and they interconnect in wildly varied ways at
locations around the world.

Please, save your breath if you can't or won't provide a traceroute,
mtr, etc showing the path and evidence of a problem, or at least a
very specific description like "we're getting complaints from Comcast
customers in Maryland trying to reach our services in Houston hosted
on Level3 and customer traceroutes seem to point to a problem at the
handoff from XO to Level3 in Dallas."

"Downed connections from multiple ISPs in different locations" without
specifying your location, your ISP(s) and the specific remote
ISP/location pairs is just barely more information than "the internets
is bork!"

Dave Hart

I think this might have just been a quick question due to an issue they were addressing.   Probably busy t-shooting and just wanted to get it out there, just in case others were having a problem.

At any given moment, I guarantee you someone somewhere is seeing
internet connectivity problems.  If they all posted to outages with
similarly vague reports, the signal/noise ratio would be so low, no
one would read it.  I'm asking medco.com and everyone else who is
tempted to ask, in effect, "is anyone else seeing any problems
anywhere on any carriers?" to provide enough detail to localize the
problem to specific carrier(s) and specific locations (endpoints or
apparent trouble spots from traces), or just keep quiet respecting the
need for signal amongst the noise.

I'm willing to hear I'm asking too much, from the list owner, or
others sufficiently clued to have provided useful details when they
post here about new issues.  Not so much from coworkers of people
reporting problems here lacking key details and soliciting responses
likely to be similarly devoid of useful details, as they're the ones
dragging down the signal:noise ratio here, which is already low and
seems to be getting worse.

Thanks for your understanding,
Dave Hart

Agreed.  If you have time to post a message you have time to do a quick 
mtr/traceroute or at least give some further information on what issues 
are being seen.

"The Internet is broken!" is for my mom using her cable modem not people 
posting on this list.

In out continuing efforts to make the list more useful and of higher S/N for
all users, I've created this wiki page:

  http://www.outages.org/index.php/How_To_Report_A_Problem

which I propose to have Jared add to the list footer once we're semi-done
fleshing it out.  Remembering the standard wiki-rules of Be Bold and Assume
Good Faith, I invite all those with something to contribute on the topic to
contribute it there.  I've included some suggested framing, but feel free to
adjust as necessary; I'll be tossing some language into it myself, right after
I... go... fix this outage.  :-)

I have some free CPU / BW at the moment and can spin you up a VM if you want to (temporarily) move stuff over so you can have a more relaxed upgrade?

Also, as always, am available for remote-hands in Ashburn area (cannot remember where the box is?) if you need  poked...

I have most of this covered its just migrating the OS, applications, databases (yes, plural) and making sure there is a good inventory of all the parts such as perl and php modules built properly, oh and moving the ipv4 and ipv6 addresses. 

So far I've abandoned a larger idea of replacing sendmail at this point. That combined with other things are making it difficult to set aside a few hours to supervise each component of the switch as everything is on a single ip/DNS name. 

I do have a written plan that will help me finalize the moving parts when it's time. It's more a matter of time. I did one related system last night and a few during the day. Just three more to go :-)

Puck is obviously the biggest one just in terms of multi-use scope. (secondary DNS services, lists, web, BGP monitoring, and the obligatory site for my wife as well. That one must go smoothly so I can sleep at night :-)

This move will be good as it brings the system to modern hardware and dumps an Os that has lagging hardware support. Will also reduce my OPEX as usable packages are available meaning mailman may be the only manually built package! Good news all around as compiling an Os from source and all the parts isn't a good use of time and resources in 2011/2012.

This is done. Lesson learned:

Triple check there are no two groups with different numerical values and the same name in /etc/group

Makes it hard when there are two mailman groups for the thing to work right......

It may be planned, but I haven't seen anything about it.  I've tried

Looks like ACLs block anything past the uoregon.edu router.  What I'm
saying is that my traceroute looks identical to the one below, so the
problem is either on the return path or is somewhere within then
network "past" the uoregon.edu router.

Probably worse than that:

$ host knology.com
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

It just seemed like general network congestion/misrouting issues: high
latency, dropped packets, etc...

It appears to be resolved now from what I can tell.
