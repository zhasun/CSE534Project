Subject: [outages] Bell Canada Routing issues to Comcast
Message-ID: <201308011551.24444.kxeron@digibase.ca>

Hi,

It appears as of 15:14 EDT today (it is now 15:48) there are routing issues 
through Bell Canada en-route to Comcast customers and much of Comcast's 
network at large (their main website is inaccessable from our perspective and 
all DNS for the comcast.net domain is unavailable).

Doing a traceroute from our network:

cplexus> traceroute 69.252.80.75
traceroute to 69.252.80.75 (69.252.80.75), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

I don't think anyone is going to be able to confirm anything without you
disclosing what the source IP of "your network" is.  Meaning: I cannot
give you results back without knowing what IP to mtr to.  And please
give me the IP of a host/server on your network, not the IP of a router.

If you want an endpoint to test against that's different than
69.252.80.75 and responds to ICMP, try 76.102.14.35.  That's my
residential Comcast connection in Mountain View, CA.

Subject: [outages] Hostgator down?
Message-ID: <f3c69a9399634696c2dfc3b73fbe1b69@mail.gmail.com>

We have several clients who use hostgator and some of them are reporting
issues with their sites. Hostgator chat service is inaccess (at least from
where I am).



Just tried to open a ticket and got this:



We are currently experiencing ongoing networking issues at our primary
datacenter. We are aware and are working with our service providers to
resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

Any other carriers experiencing issues with FedEx (possible issue with
access to their SSL infrastructure and/or an in-house server/routing issue)?

Tested from AS40911, AS11852, AS13768 and a couple of Comcast commercial
modems with the same results.

Might not be related to "national" network transit infrastructure, however
our phones are lighting up as a result of such issue.

Sorry - should have been more specific...

Our customers and others can reach the main "Fedex" website, however, when
you attempt(ed) to login, it forwards the post to another URL, which was
unreachable for about 39 minutes.

However - It is now reachable and was a relatively short outage, per say.

Thanks to all of whom helped to investigate the issue.

Kindly,

also.  Our rep confirmed a widespread outage with no ETR.

FYI, the Wikimedia Foundation folks saw the same issue earlier, but it
resolved itself from their view as well.

No root cause identified, but apparently a valid report...

Message-ID: <20130814133521.GA7699@infiltrated.net>

Been noticing scattered DNS issues which are not isolated
to an individual network, e.g., I use Global/Level3, but
am now having customers inside of Paetec's network also
seeing issues. Anyone else seeing anomalies this morning?

Sites timing out, not resolving one minute, then resolving
the next. E.g. here is another instance:

https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/367641489498992640

His site passes through Global/Level3, I couldn't reach
him with GBLX/Level3 DNS, but could with 8.8.8.8 his site
appeared down from downforeveryoneorjustme.com but was
resolvable in some instances.

I have clients in NY complaining about reaching servers
I can reach, but their networks can't. So its scattered
and I haven't figured out a common theme.

krebsonsecurity.com is delegated to ns1.prolexic.com and ns2.prolexic.com.

I'm seeing both those nameservers respond with non-authoritative answers for krebsonsecurity.com/IN/SOA.

Jakob's robot seems to see similarly:

  http://dnscheck.se/log.pl?domain=krebsonsecurity.com&date=last

So does AFNIC's, at least some of the time:

  http://www.zonecheck.fr/zonecheck/cgi-bin/zc.cgi?zone=krebsonsecurity.com

Those prolexic nameservers are surely anycast; it seems possible that they have a problem where some of their nodes are serving the zone accurately and some are not. That seems consistent with the kind of unpredictable results you're describing.

If there was a problem with the zone or the servers that are serving it, it's quite possible that it has since been fixed and what you're seeing is fallout from cached bad answers.

I don't know where you got that FQDN from.  The log doesn't mention any
such FQDN.  The log reports A record lookup failures for
dns.ewr1.nytimes.com.  And I can confirm thAt problem.

Per a.gtld-servers.net:

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
nytimes.com.            172800  IN      NS      dns.sea1.nytimes.com.
nytimes.com.            172800  IN      NS      dns.ewr1.nytimes.com.

;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
dns.sea1.nytimes.com.   172800  IN      A       170.149.173.133
dns.ewr1.nytimes.com.   172800  IN      A       170.149.168.134

Neither 170.149.173.133 or 170.149.168.134 are responding to queries (A
records for www.nytimes.com, NS records for sea1.nytimes.com or
ewr1.nytimes.com (not sure if there are any), A records for the
aforementioned FQDNs, etc.).  Or the response may be spotty -- I did not
try more than a couple times.

Both IPs respond to ICMP ECHO, so if resolution isn't working, the
possibilities/reasons why are almost endless.  Rather not speculate.

appears to be internal to MS, but it may be a good idea to give any 365

DNS is fine, as are the front-end HTTP servers for both the main and the archive sites.  I actually have authoritative information from NYT staff about what's happening, and it's a self-inflicted wound, having to do with a software update that was rolled out to both the production and backup servers simultaneously.  And failed, obviously.

Subject: [outages] Upcoming Cubby maintenance - on Sunday, August 18, 2013
Message-ID: <520d0d18.836c440a.3137.34dc@mx.google.com>

HEADS UP.

 

We are constantly striving to provide you with the best cloud service
possible. In order to do this, we sometimes must take Cubby offline to
ensure that all of the necessary improvements are properly implemented.

 

During this maintenance cubby.com and all cloud-based services will be
unavailable. This includes access to cubbies on the cloud, cloud-based
syncing, and access from a mobile device. Local content and DirectSyncTM
will remain available. 

 

The scheduled maintenance will affect users for approximately 6 hours on
Sunday, August 18, 2013 at the following local times:

.   2:00AM EST - 8:00AM EST 

 

.   7:00AM GMT - 1:00PM GMT

.   4:00PM AEST - 10:00PM AEST

 

We appreciate your understanding and apologize for any inconvenience this
may cause. 

 

Thank you,

 

The Cubby Team

 

 

 

 

Ruff, Ruff...!

Follow-up to this, which I just found out about today:

First, this Wild Wacky Action Bike of sorts (note what site posted it
and hold that thought):

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2013/08/14/new-york-times-web-site-goes-down-panicked-mobs-stream-into-street-demanding-to-know-the-trends/

...which was later debunked -- turns out the NYT was doing maintenance
of some sort which broke stuff (brings into question why they were doing
this during peak morning hours):

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/business/media/new-york-times-web-site-returns-after-hours-offline.html?_r=0

And further analysis of some sort:

http://www.zdnet.com/what-happened-to-the-new-york-times-website-7000019453/

And now the irony:

Subject: [outages] Zayo Issue in New York Area
Message-ID: <OFF9A74145.27F8E6CE-ON85257BC8.006ACDF9-85257BC8.006B5225@portware.com>

At 2:35pm EDT we saw our Zayo Metro Ethernet connection between New York 
city and New Jersey go down with the port on the New York side down hard. 
Is anyone else seeing issues with Zayo circuits in the New York area?

I've been on hold waiting for support for about 15 minutes so seems like 
they are experiencing heavy call volumes which may be due to a larger 
outage.

Thanks.

Hi Mike,

That dig really just demonstrates that you have a local cached answer.
If you want to check whether the authority servers are reachable from
5645, you need to send explicit queries to each one (and avoid +short,
since you want to check the RCODE).

Hi Joe, yes I did a +trace and all of the other tests but omitted the output partially due to its length and partially from multitasking; doing too many things at once :)

GRN VoIP seems to be completely off the air does anyone know if they went
out of business? If anyone doesn?t know who they are they are a wholesale
International and US Domestic VoIP termination.

Did anyone else see access issues to amazon.com down from 8:50 am to 9:04
am, and then again from 9:09 am until 9:19 am (Central)?  I was getting
"HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable".  Their dashboard only shows an issue
with their Flexible Payments Service.

It's not down, it's just "unavailable while we make some improvements to
our service".

Or at least, that's what the page I get when I go to it now shows.

It's true, I did get a message about it being down for 'service
improvements' and now I am getting an HTTP 500.

Location: Central Wisconsin

Thanks,

When I was in Amazon network engineering we called that the "Gone Fishing"
page. Basic static server for when the DB takes a crap.  Of course that was
back in 2000 when Gone Fishing was a single 600MHz Pent 3 box running BSD
and Apache.  I'm sure it's a bit more complex setup now ;)

Getting no content at this moment. I am a "lifetime" Feedly Pro user,
and yes, I have a message out to them on status.

But figured it might be worth asking others who use Feedly if they are
experiencing the same thing.

Thanks,

I just pulled 1400+ feed updates into d7 Reader Pro for Android, marked a bunch read, etc. with no problem, FWIW.

Anyone noticing HostGator down again?  We're contacting them about our
server -- but trying to figure out if it's wider spread or not ? especially
given the outage from a couple of weeks ago during the "upgrade".

Thanks!

I'm not having any issues reaching (via SSH or HTTP) my friend's
HostGator-hosted stuff within 192.232.192.0/19 (if you check ARIN
you'll see this is labelled "HGBLOCK-8" despite the OrgName being
something odd; HG = HostGator).  ICMP also works:

So the issue may be specific to just your server, or some part of
HostGator -- but definitely not "the whole thing".

It appears to not be down -- but suddenly, every one of my networks is
blocked.  (Multiple IP blocks).  I can see our server is up when I go over
cellular.  The IPs are not listed in our box's firewall.

NYT is tweeting out their links with the IP 170.149.168.130 so they are

It's been all over the news for hours; yes, it's happening, yes, it appears

From OpenDNS I see:  (208.67.222.222)

;; ANSWER SECTION:
nytimes.com.		10699	IN	A	141.105.64.37

From Google DNS (8.8.8.8) I see:    note SOA is different:

;; ANSWER SECTION:

From our own resolver I see:

;; ANSWER SECTION:
nytimes.com.		154278	IN	NS	dns.sea1.nytimes.com.
nytimes.com.		154278	IN	NS	dns.ewr1.nytimes.com.



As for what nytimes.com is resolving to, from trying a few places I see:

141.105.64.37  - 141.105.64.0/21 AS49335  (NCONNECT), where Shorefront Media, Inc/Navitel Rusconnect is registered for 141.105.64.0/26
170.149.172.130 - 170.149.0.0/16  (New York Times)

Just changed again (from boxsecured.com to nytimes.com), apparently
for the proper ones.

Predicting that it's more widespread than just nytimes.com - compare whois
of twimg.com and nytimes.com.

What server did you query?  If you're using the cached NS records for
nytimes.com, ...
