There are the Myanmar issues, playing out on AS 9988, AS 3333 and AS 9925.
9988 is the Myanmar Post and Telecom dude which officially listens to
203.81.64.20 and forks off SESAmericom. 3333 is the Ripe pipe 193.0.12.151.
Holds A and PTR records. 9925 is the HK TDCS Powerbase Datacenter
connection, aka 202.153.125.17 and sometimes active as
serv017.communilink.net.

If you're close to those communities you may be affected.

Cheers,
Bert

Subject: [Outages] Internet loss in Asia?


We just lost three sites for a customer in Singapore, Malaysia, and Pune,
India. Anyone have any idea if anything is going on in Asia? Two sites just
have an internet connection, and one has an MPLS setup as well as an
internet link. Odd all three went down at the same time. Another earth quake
maybe?

Ok,

	It seems like this project is taking WAY WAY WAY longer than
it should. I live in the area. I pass the Woodbury area constantly...

	Whats the deal?! Its not like we are having hurricanes and
tornadoes and the likes. Do I need to go over and supervise this???

It was centered between San Jose and Fremont, according to the map at
the USGS site. Life in Mountain View appears normal. Cellphone (AT&T)
