Anyone seeing packet loss going through .so-6-0-0.xt1.lax7.alter.net for hosts on Verizon but on the East Coast dying?  

Have a prefix that isn't available if data comes into Verizon on the west coast only.

We just opened a ticket with Verizon and were informed of outages for Verizon on East Coast.

Had a customer call in 10 minutes ago about inability to get VPN access to
one of our sites...their traceroute was also stuck at alter.net (in NYC, I
believe), they told me over the phone.  But it came back 4 minutes, before I
could get my own traceroute in.  When I was running my ping (before the
traceroute) I was seeing some pings of over 1 second.

I can confirm that something is going on with Vz/MCI/UUnet/Alternet on
the west coast; there's a large number of route denouncements and
announcements being witnessed causing all kinds of (broken)
reconvergence with packets destined to the east coast as well as the
south.

I don't have any other information.  BGPlay might come in handy.

seeing similar on the east coast; somewhere between alter.net (vzb)  
and level3 in nyc just before the chi hop.

at least that's what my traceroute is telling me.

This also seemed to have effected Europe connecting to Verizon routes in
Denver and Sydney...  and a Circuit we have on VZB in New York reaching
much of the internet...

Looks to be stable again now...

I'll add here that NANOG also has a couple threads going on about
this which appear quite relevant, but it's hard to tell what's broken
and why at this point.

I'll be very interested to know what the root cause of this was.

All the discussion indicates there is a single point of failure
somewhere within Verizon's network out east; route propagation and
reconvergence should have mitigated things, so the question is why it
didn't.

There appears to be a major outage on VZB Internet facing side of the
switch (east coast).

VZB west coast seems to be ok, at least for AS701 (uunet).

Verizon Business is having some issues with unreachability to various  
destinations.

For instance, I cannot reach OpenDNS right now.  A colleague on FiOS  
is having issues reaching a great number of places.  Etc.

Is anyone seeing the problem in other geographic areas?

Anyone seeing packet loss going through .so-6-0-0.xt1.lax7.alter.net for
hosts on Verizon but on the East Coast dying?  

Have a prefix that isn't available if data comes into Verizon on the
west coast only.

I have FiOS in North NJ and it was flapping on and off, but recently  
has seemed to fully recover.

This was posted on VZ's website as an explanation for the outage
!
Original Link:
http://forums.verizon.com/t5/Verizon-at-Home/Northeast-Router-Failure/ba
-p/87001
!
"As many of you may know, a router failed in the Verizon network this
afternoon causing problems for some Verizon FiOS and High Speed Internet
users. Here's what happened.

The router in question is in New York City and handles traffic from the
Verizon network to the larger Internet. It is one of a number of such
routers in our network.

When routers have problems, they are designed to report that they are
sick. Internet traffic is rerouted to adjacent routers automatically and
sent around the trouble spot. In this case, that didn't happen. The
router went into a hung state and did not appear to the rest of the
network as though it was having problems.

That meant that some user traffic from the northeast continued to flow
to the stalled router, but couldn't be processed. Presto - an outage for
those users.  Verizon FiOS, High Speed Internet and small business
customers were affected.

The problem occurred at approximately 3:15 EDT and was detected and
resolved :40 minutes later. Traffic began to flow normally and customers
returned to service at that point. 

Currently, we're monitoring the router and the network watching for any
other problems."

FYI, there was a power outage in downtown LA about that time.  None of
my stuff dropped (carrier center, 600 hope), no diesel fumes from

It appears BFD is a protocol foreign to Verizon.  And why didn't hold
timers expire on associated iBGP peers?  Questions, questions...

You might try being a little more specific and include something to

That statement sounds like something an end user would say when they 
dont know what is happening.

On one ISP you can ping some sites that you cannot ping on the other

For info
Fiji is covered by only one AS registered with FINTEL

FINTEL is conected to the Southern Cross Cable

Fintel then distribute Internet to Connect/TFL, Kidanet and Unwired

Vodafone is under Kidanet

I just got that from one of the ISPs in Fiji.

----
This is to inform you that Fiji International Telecommunications Limited (FINTEL) has issued a public notice advising its customers that a segment of the Southern Cross Cable is under technical maintenance until 2300UTC 14th October, 2009. They have also advised that this timeline may change due to circumstances beyond their control (e.g. weather).

During this time FINTEL has advised that there should be minimum disruptions to all Fiji traffic bound for this segment however they have also stated that during this time, the Southern Cross Cable Network will be considered in a hazardous state.

Best I can confirm is that it is affecting many fiber, and possibly some

I'm pretty sure *nobody* is clueless enough to run BGP over a cablemodem. ;)

BGP peer came back up at 12:55 AM PDT this morning.  Don't have an RFO
yet, but did receive a maintenance notification this morning, scheduled
for 10/22 for "network expansion". :)

http://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi

currently lists only one server for me, where there are usually many
to chose from. I also noticed that the status column is missing.

I'm unable to determine if this is a scheduled maintenance.

We saw the level 3 peering bounce, but it looked like after it came back up,
there was some traffic being blackholed between level3 and regional
providers.

Things have recovered in the last 10-15 minutes.

Looks like it's all back up as of about 30 mins ago.

Apparently either a core switch or router failed, which took down much of
their network in Atlanta, as well as Memphis and Nashville.

Thanks,

Cogent's got a backbone issue on the east coast.  It is possibly related.

Level 3 has a single router or switch handling packets at a major POP?
I doubt this, but the outage is confirmation something bad happened.

That said: where's the redundancy, and why didn't it kick in?

with reachability to Atlanta...

There are four routes into Atlanta, I believe.

Getting to Atlanta wasn't a problem.

Between the Atlanta hub and the customers was the problem.  Can't give every
customer two connections for the price of one =/

It's possible the faulty device was an aggregation router and only those
customers connected to it saw the outage. Redundancy within Level(3)'s
network would not have helped customers with only a single connection
off the affected device. At some point it becomes the customer's
responsibility to redundantly connect to their upstreams (as in buy two
connections on different aggregation routers :-).

 

I didn't see any L3 issues up here in Detroit, so whatever outage L3 had
was apparently contained within that one POP or region. No cascade
failures I can see...

Just got an RFO from Level 3...

A Core router in Atlanta crashed and failed over. But the redundant router didn't pass any traffic so they had to reload the router that crashed. They have opened a ticket with their hardware vendor. My tech that called wasn't as nosey as I wanted him to be so he didn't get any device and node information. But this sounds like Cisco Cisco and more Cisco issues. The GSR's are EOL so I bet it was one of them.

There are multiple devices there handling intra and inter-pop traffic. 
NOC still investigating with vendor. 

Redundancy won't kick in if soft or silent failures occur and 
the control plane keeps protocols up but forwarding is affected.
Unfortunately these types of failures still happen from time to
time especially with multi-member LAG groups.

No details on this specific event however.

No they aren't.  The original three chassis are EOL (12008, 12012, and 
the five-rail 12016), but the other nine chassis (three in the 12000 
series, four in the 12400 series, and two in the 12800 series) do appear 
to be alive and kicking.

I have a peering with them in Atlanta which bounced during the outage. Per 
their noc the switch just froze and began eating (my term) packets without 
actually causing peerings to go down.  They rebooted it which is when our 
peerings were reset.  They are monitoring and have been stable since the 
issue.

They claim it should be back up now. Same router failed that the majority of
the traffic was flowing through. L3 tech told me they've powered it down
now. I haven't verified this for myself yet.

This is resolved.  One of their customers in the facility was under a denial
of service attack.  I imagine some sort of mitigation technique was
employed.  No further details were available.

The RFO that went out somewhat after he asked that was more useful...
N=2 redundancy was in place.  However, when primary had hardware
failure, secondary had (unknown / unstated) software, config, or
hardware failure that hadn't been detected or checked, and it didn't
work either.

It's hard to test clusters of things well when they have near-100%
uptime requirements.  The dependability of the untested failover unit
is low, as you're not testing it well.

Sometimes you can test failovers in stream.  But sometimes those
supposedly harmless failover tests fail for baroque reasons, taking
down a service when the primary was in fact just fine.

This isn't (just) an economics problem.  Reliability of complex
problems is an mathematically exponentially hard problem to crack from

Some people don't try - and get what they deserve - and some people
give it a good or best commercial reasonable effort, and still fail.
Doing better than that is really hard.

I'm not in Atlanta but from what was mentioned on the list, it was a soft 
failure which is why the other routers didn't failover w/ HSRP or whatnot:

   https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2009-October/001607.html
   https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2009-October/001608.html

The real question should be why nobody powered down that device the first 
or second time, considering it didn't failover properly the first time.

These things happen from time-to-time -- that's the Internet.

Hello

I was wondering if I could pose a general question to all out there
who watch and or interact with RackSapce specifically their DFW data
center.

It "feels" as if since the beginning of October our testing results
which we hit Rack Space with at a interval of one minute have been
coming back all over the place. Specifically we test out from Huston,
DC and Chicago

When I have called into them and chatted with their back bone teams I
hear the same answer of "everything looks good." Interesting enough I
now also hear some how Equinix being stated into their responses.

So questions for anyone out there is:
1. Has anyone else seen the same oddities for Rack Space DFW?
2. Does anyone know if Rack Space DFW recently peered their traffic
through Equinix DFW
3. The most recent alert/blip we received was 10-23-2009 at 2:49AM Eastern

Thanks for your time and assistance,
Ed
