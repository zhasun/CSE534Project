So these apparent optimal routes by ASN, are sometimes significantly less optimal.

If its the span between Singapore and Indonesia then this only affects
Indonesia and western Australia... SG, HK, JP are well served by many other

Possibly related to yesterday's DNSimple outage..

f.cl.ly.                600     IN      CNAME   f.cl.ly.s3.amazonaws.com.

Looks like ns0-4 are pointing to an IP that just loads a (sketchy) search
results page (example: http://54.235.159.97/) for the domain name. But
ns5-7 are pointing to the correct IP via a CNAME to aws.

Looking at https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/cl.ly it seems that more and more
countries are getting the 97 (incorrect) IP. Haven't seen any tweets from
@cloudapp about the problem either but I have seen a bunch of other people
complaining.

Anybody happen to see anything similar or hear about any GTT incidents

You can use IP 91.121.254.222 to test.

There's a fiber cut in the Houston area that seems to be impacting a

Further updates as events warrant.

Hi Outages.org List,

I'm seeing very intermittent packet loss and latency spikes inbound and 
outbound from Latisys Chicago. Is anyone else experiencing issues? Our 
host who collocates their equipment there has told us that Latisys is 
having a network event. Any more information on this?

According to the tracert's the issue seems to be within Latisys.

There was a very strong storm that moved though the bay area. Not sure 
if that has anything to do with this here.

Further info from Cogent:

Cogent reports this was caused due to a NTP amplification attack on 
another customer.

The issue came back at around 9:15AM PST for about 10 minutes, and again 
at 9:35PM PST for about 5 minutes.  Cogent says these were due to the 
same customer being attacked.

Seems hop 7 and 8 are the same box.... This traceroute works fine from AT&T
and Sprint, they deliver it correctly to Korea instead of black-holing it
in LAX

Few things to say here:

1) I can confirm the behaviour from Comcast, whose packtes in this case
are traversing a different L3 router.

 9. ???

2) I can confirm "oddities" from my VPS in SoCal, who tends to have good
peering.

 Host                                                               Loss%   Snt   Rcv  Last   Avg  Best  Wrst

 3. r1.lax.arpnetworks.com (208.79.88.2)                             0.0%     6     6   0.7   0.7   0.6   0.8
 4. ???

3) Looking through route-views.routeviews.org we see something very
interesting:

route-views>traceroute 1.201.0.39
Type escape sequence to abort.
Tracing the route to 1.201.0.39
VRF info: (vrf in name/id, vrf out name/id)

  6 sig-tech.fe3-1.br01.seo01.pccwbtn.net (63.218.149.86) [AS 3491] !A  !A  !A

"!A" means "communication with destination network administratively
prohibited", i.e. ICMP type 3 code 9.

4) Using HE's looking glass:

core1.fmt2.he.net> traceroute 1.201.0.39
  traceroute to 1.201.0.39 (1.201.0.39), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

 7  121.189.3.46  143.521 ms !X  143.405 ms !X  143.380 ms !X

"!X" means "communication administratively prohibited", i.e. ICMP type 3
code 13.  121.189.3.46 according to ARIN is allocated to Korea Telecom.
This could be an edge router rule blocking probe traffic, not sure.

5) Cogent's looking glass shows similar to HE:

12  121.189.3.46 (121.189.3.46)  232.136 ms !X  232.086 ms !X

6) And finally, NTT's looking glass:

It seems like it's limited to FiOS Voice and Internet services...

Any idea on a time line? Been on hold with Verizon for an hour, websites
doesn't say anything. I have been trying to sign up for their outage
alerts, but when their site does work, it sends me in a loop.

Anyone else seeing anything ?  Their status page is all green at the moment.

I?m getting failures on certain Cloudflare IPv6 address.

Traceroutes and curl loops below.

I don't use this barracuda product but I do use another so when I
logged into https://login.barracudanetworks.com/auth/login/

I saw this message:

The Barracuda Email Security Service is currently experiencing delays
in email traffic for a segment of our customers. We are actively
working to resolve the issue and will provide further updates here[0].
If you are experiencing delays, please file a support ticket here[1].

Just got your message, 11 hours later. =)

We saw the issue start Monday at 4:30 pm U.S. Central.  Our email server
logs noted:
	Open (64.235.150.197) Error 21sec (399 TCP Read failed (Connection
timed out after 0 seconds) 0 sec)
A few messages delivered Monday evening (last one was 6:46 am), but they
were at a stand-still this morning. 

More here:

https://twitter.com/barracuda?lang=en&lang=en

It appears that Barracuda didn't really dig in until this morning, at which
time they changed host IPs so that customers using their host as the
domain's MX record automatically would get the new IP (TTL-depending).

More on mailops, too.
