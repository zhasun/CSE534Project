While we don?t use them for very much anymore (for this very reason), it seems PacWest is hard down at the moment.

None of our numbers in any footprint are routing.

Going on about 20 minutes now?

We are having identical issues here in Northern California. Either fast
busy signals or "all circuits are busy" messages.

Update from PacWest NOC:

Master ticket 293514 was opened to track this matter.



At this time we see traffic returning to normal levels. We do not have the
"all clear" as of yet however.


We are not seeing any inbound traffic come through on our end yet.
Hopefully this resolves shortly.

Looks like eNom is fairly hosed at the moment.

No connections to their API, website down.  Our logs say it started
around 08:51 and is still ongoing.

I could find nothing about this on eNom's twitter page.

Message-ID: <CAO6HNz7Rpa=SO_Qraw+1V-sMM4De2aBpEQsZQuXGQL4u7sFJ-w@mail.gmail.com>

So I've tried from a few different networks in the SF Bay Area and
Level(3)'s anycast DNS servers seem to be having trouble resolving
anything.

4.2.2.1 through 6, and 209.244.0.3 and 4

% dig @4.2.2.2 google.com

; <<>> DiG 9.5.1-P3 <<>> @4.2.2.2 google.com
; (1 server found)
;; global options:  printcmd
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

They do still seem to have root hints though.

Anyone seeing crazy amounts of spoofing that are going out to what looks
like address book entries?

In other words, not from your client, not from your server, but spoofing an
email address that's yours, and going to recipients that look like your
address book (e.g., grouped by last name and to people you know).

I don't want to point fingers, and I have no evidence of this in any way,
but it almost looks like a social network site, that may have access to
address book entries, got hit -- and someone is spoofing big time.

The other option would be a Mac virus hitting address book entries.

Anyone seeing anything this?

I received one today. Came from an aol user, via aol servers. It looks like
malware on their (windows) computer.

The last time I saw something like this (personally) was a few years
ago, happening to younger friends of mine who used Facebook.  The
problem wasn't Facebook itself though.  What happened:

- Some person they knew shared a link/URL on Facebook, stating "funny
  video!" or the like -- same person probably had some compromised
  system of their own
- Facebook friend visits link/URL
- Link/site contained both malicious Javascript and Flash exploits
  to install a trojan/malware.  (The exploits at the time were so new
  that anti-virus/malware software didn't detect them)
  -- The "funny video" got shown, so the visitor had no idea what was
  going on under the hood
- Trojan/malware under the hood begins scanning all address books
  (including any local browser content cache that looks like an address
  book, as well as things like Outlook address books -- pretty much
  everything under the sun), as well as tried to figure out what their
  own name was
- Same trojan/malware attempted TCP port 25 connection to whatever SMTP
  server was configured in a local Email client (I forget how it worked
  this out, but it wasn't using an open relay from what I could tell)
  and proceeded to send Email to multiple recipients as follows:
  -- SMTP-level MAIL FROM was their own Email address
  -- SMTP-level RCPT TO was to themselves (I think?)
  -- Mail header From: line was their own name + Email address
  -- Mail header To: line was to themselves
  -- Mail header Cc: line contained multiple address book recipients
  -- Body of mail contained aforementioned link/URL and nothing else (if
  I remember correctly)

I was one of the CC'd individuals.  What got my attention was the fact
that I got two mails about the same thing -- one from a younger friend
of mine, and one later from one of the people on the CC list (indicating
something was spreading).

Once I got my hands on my younger friends' laptop, I found the malware
itself actively running and ended up reformatting the entire system.

Not sure if this is what you were seeing or not; if so it may just be
another form of the same thing.  In short, yes, addressbook scanning is
something that some malwares now do.

I've seen (work, family, friends) an increased amount of spoofing since
February 25.

 

The first two emails I looked at that day were sent thru email servers in UK
and France.

While not spoofing specifically, we've been seeing abnormally high amounts of general nefarious network activity this year. It was especially bad during the height of the ntp ddos problem in January/February but still seems higher than it was last year.

I keep an old email address out there just so I can trend the spam in the world.  I usually get 250-300 messages a day of junk in that mailbox, with peak counts being M-F 6am to 6pm Mountain Time.

Since Thursday last week, I have been averaging almost 450 a day, with a peak of 630 messages yesterday.  I have had reports from a few family members saying they have seen Email with my name on it, but smash keyboard email addresses over the past few weeks as well.

Twitter is blowing up with outage reports for UVerse across several
geographical locations.

AT&T call centers, of course, unreachable for hours by now.

Looks like just a TV services outage from the reports. Internet unaffected.

[ moving to -discuss; hope everyone's there ]

It's been posited that the end of security updates for WinXP will be 
likely to cause an uptick in the amount of bot sent spam and attacks.

Something which -- by the way -- might be easier to kill off if all
edge network operators were implementing BCP38.

BCP38: ask for it by name!

Cheers,

Just got on update on our Lightower ticket for the outage since 11:20am eastern:

Lightower has identified damage near Park Avenue and 18th (2 blocks south of 300 Blvd). A Backhoe onsite has dug up Level 3 owned conduit which contains Lightower fiber. Level 3 has technicians and civil contractors headed to the location for repair. Lightower is investigating all opportunities to repair this cable ahead of the Level 3 conduit repair. Lightower provided fiber contractors are mobilizing to the location to assist with this investigation. No ETTR At this time.

Hi Everyone,

I have a couple sites hosted on bluehost.com and a couple are down right
now but not all of them.  BlueHosts online chat system is down and there is
an automated message on their help line saying they are having network
issues.

Is anyone aware of a widespread Level(3) outage this morning shortly before 10AM Mountain?  Our traces were dying at the edge of both twtelecom and Comcast.

Unsure if this is related to the L3 issues or not.  Savvis, at least at
the CH3 datacenter, has had bad connectivity problems since 3:20AM CDT.
Internet Pulse shows atrocious packet loss to almost everywhere from
Savvis.

Master case number at Savvis is 4579123.  They don't have any more info
than "yep, we're down, working on it".

I don't know the details but I've heard that we're having problems with
Level3 in the Atlanta area.

This outage is still ongoing and has far-reaching implications beyond their
CH3 facility.  I have servers in DC3 (Sterling, VA/Washington, DC) and
haven't been able to reach 12.0.0.0/8 among other networks since early this
morning.

Looks like things will get worse before they get better.  Here's their
latest update:

DATE OF EVENT: Tuesday, April 22, 2014
TIME OF EVENT : 03:20 CDT
MASTER CASE: 4579123

UPDATE: In effort to resolve an ongoing incident, CenturyLink will be
reloading several internet facing backbone devices within our network.
This emergency maintenance will potentially result in an intermittent loss
of connectivity and/or latency for up to 15 minutes.  Clients with
non-redundant ATS MPLS and EVPL connectivity could experience additional
impact during this maintenance.  This activity is required to address a
resource constraint on several peering and hosting routers within the
CenturyLink backbone network.  CenturyLink will notify all impacted clients
via email at the beginning and after the completion of the maintenance
activity.  We apologize for the inconvenience.

Yeah. This has been a disaster, and we've been seeing this since at least 9:00 AM CDT. I can't even make it from my apartment on the west side of Chicago over to CH3 without seeing 85% packet loss (via Comcast). 

The most recent we've heard is that they'll be doing their rebooting of stuff 6-8 hours after 3:00 PM, so 9:00 to 11:00. We'll see. In the interim, I think I'll order another pint. ;)

When I spoke to someone at their incident team around 6:50PM, they said
the same "in the next 6-8 hours" window, so until 3AM?  Yikes.  The ~4PM
email said they would "notify all impacted clients via email at the
beginning and after the completion of the maintenance activity" and I
still haven't received anything.

Yeah, we've yet to receive anything as well. Their communication during this has been, uh, less than stellar.

And right as I mention that:

EVENT UPDATE 2100: The maintenance to repair the connectivity/latency issue within the Chicago region will begin at 00:00 CT and completed by 04:00 CT. Next update will be provided as we start the maintenance and hourly updates will be provided throughout the maintenance.

I went to bed in despair :)  Overnight updates: 2345-0330 things were
rebooted (sessions bounced, etc).  0330 brought "Repairs on node 2 in the
Chicago region uncovered a possible issue with a card in node 2. We are
still expecting to complete repairs at 0400 CT. But may run over by a half
hour."

Last update at 0446 was "We have completed repairs in the Chicago region,
but are seeing a small subset of clients with aberrant behavior. Further
updates will be sent within an hour."

Packet loss certainly seems to have gotten better.

Looks like TWC can't reach Google when coming from the triangle.  Been
broken for about 20 mins so far.

Mixed results reaching destinations - some dying in Level3, some getting through. After about 15 min, all looked normal, but reviewing my router in Boston, MA area showed our Level3 BGP session had also bounced ~12 min prior... Couldn't hit www.google.com or microcenter.com from within Comcast, neither of which are via Level3 from Comcast Boston, so something larger was amiss.

I had a customer forward me this yesterday.  We lost a connection to Level3
yesterday for a few minutes.


Dear Valued Customer,

Peak 10 has confirmed with Level 3, one of the Internet providers in both
Nashville and Tampa, that the service disruption at 11:45am EST to their
Internet circuits in these locations was the result of work incorrectly
performed by a field technician in their POP in Atlanta.  The technician
removed the incorrect cards from two backbone routers.  This resulted in
multiple routing devices becoming isolated on the network which interrupted
the flow of Internet traffic from Peak 10 to Level 3.  The cards were
replaced and services were confirmed to be restored once BGP re-converged.
The circuits have been monitored since early this afternoon and have been
operating as expected.

Peak 10 engineers will be re-activating the Level 3 circuits in both
Nashville and Tampa tonight at 9pm EST.  There should be no negative impact
as a result of this work.

Should you have any questions or require any further assistance, please
contact the Peak 10 Support Team at 866-732-5836 or email at
support at peak10.com.
 
Thank you,

Anyone aware of any Level3 issues in the Atlanta area? We have two circuits

Hi there

Unable to stream Netflix near Toronto ON Canada.  Confirmed via Netflix
website that they are having issues currently.  It does not state if this
is an international issue or something regionalized at this point although
http://canadianoutages.com/status/netflix would seem to indicate it is
pretty widespread.

We are currently experiencing technical issues on our website.

I wonder if this is related to UltraDNS DDoS attack.  Also, major Salesforce.com outages at the moment.  Might all be related?

Hi there

Unable to stream Netflix near Toronto ON Canada.  Confirmed via Netflix website that they are having issues currently.  It does not state if this is an international issue or something regionalized at this point although http://canadianoutages.com/status/netflix would seem to indicate it is pretty widespread.

We are currently experiencing technical issues on our website.
We are working to resolve the problem. We apologize for any inconvenience.

too now.

Likely caused by the UltraDNS DDOS. ?Is it back up now?
