I'm being told by PCCW / BTN access support that multiple OC-192's and

Message-ID: <478C1FC2.2010308@visp.net>

Anyone have the scoop on a supposed fiber bundle cut in the Portland, OR 
area?  We have a DS3 in the area that's been dead in the water for over 
8 hours, and I'm now getting conflicting stories from our carrier and 
LEC technicians.

The affected link backhauls all of our DSL subscribers in this area to 
our gear, so I have many people who want my head on a nicely decorated 
platter now...

Thanks. :)

One of our vendor/customers has been reporting a fiber cut in the "North 
Western US Region, affecting major carriers."  Some of their customers 
may experience loss of Caller ID and/or Long Distance dialing.  Initial 
report 1441CST showing 4-6 hours until fiber is repaired and a possibly 
wrong start time of 2330CST.  First follow-up at 1630CST showing 
estimated 24 hours until fiber is repaired and a start time of 1330CST. 
  Second follow-up at 1930CST still showing 24 hours to repair, but with 
a resolution update indicating "Major National Carrier(s) fiber repair 
teams have been on site splicing the damaged fiber.  The fiber repair is 
scheduled for completion tonight between 1900CST and 2300CST."

I know they have at least some operations in the Seattle area, either 
organically or via acquisition, but their trouble reports are often 
vague, last-minute, misdirected, erroneous, or a combination thereof, so 
take any or all of the above with the appropriate pinch of salt.  (Their 
post-mortems are worse, with <someone> outright lying to me: the 
technician was honest about their mixup, saying "we plugged your 
transport OC3 into our router, OOPS!!!", but the VP saying "<your> OC3 
is set up as a UPSR while the OC48 is BLSR.  <Our technician> deleted a 
logical cross connect while turning up an OC12 on our network.  This 
cross connect was the protect side of one of the STS1s on your OC3 but 
did not map correctly during a ring switch event on the 48 because it 
was not there.  <Another technician> corrected the problem but had some 
difficulty explaining this to your data guy as a transport guy."

All is well again with our issue; Global Crossing has reportedly
re-spliced the fiber, and states that the length of the outage was
primarily caused by the difficulty in accessing the cable due to the
break being near the banks of the Columbia River.

I've been told that there are 2 issues.  One was fiber cut, I believe in
the Houston area.  The second issue was a card failure, also in the
Houston area.  Both failures contributed to a loss on a backbone ring
that covers a portion of the Midwest.  The master ticket number is
2332102 for those who want updates.

Not sure if this has been cleared up yet, or...

OPTUS has scrambled to restore broadband service to corporate customers
across Queensland following a major outage at one of its network facilities
in Brisbane.
An Optus spokeswoman confirmed that the outage occurred at the carrier's
Moorooka Exchange south of Brisbane's CBD early today, crippling its
corporate grade ADSL in areas across the state.

"Optus engineers are currently on site working to resolve the issue as a
priority. Services are being progressively restored as network restoration
continues and we expect all services to be back up and running later this
evening," the spokeswoman said.

Optus was today trying to playing down the impact of the outage.

It is understood that the Moorooka facility, which is owned and operated by
Optus, provides a central hub for its ADSL services around the state.

An Optus corporate customer, who asked not to be named, said that the
carrier had reported that around 1800 services were affected by the outage.

Optus that a portion of its corporate DSL services had been affected by the
outage but said that "the majority of services have not been".

The spokeswoman declined to offer further detail and said "at this stage we
are focused on fixing the problem to ensure services affected are returned
to normal as soon as possible."

If its not one cable, its another cable.

Huge swathes of the Middle East and Asia have been left without internet
access after a vital undersea cable was damaged.

A fault in the pipeline, which runs between Sicily and Egypt, has
dramatically reduced access in countries including Saudi Arabia, Dubai and
India, leaving millions of workers struggling to get online.

Following is the email that FLAG NOC sent to FLAG customers on the issue.

Dear Customer,
Flag has confirmed a sub sea cable cut at 8.3 kms, from the Alexandria beach
manhole, in a similar location to a reported SMW4 cut earlier this morning.
FLAG has contacted it's marine repair agency and is progressing application

Subject: [Outages] Internet failure hits two continents
Message-ID: <OF8732A300.F31BDF31-ON862573E1.005E07A7-862573E1.005D8F31@fitchratings.com>


DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Large swathes of Asia, the Middle East
and north Africa had their high-technology services crippled Thursday
following a widespread Internet failure which brought many businesses to a
standstill and left others struggling to cope.

One major telecommunications provider blamed the outage, which started
Wednesday, on a major undersea cable failure in the Mediterranean.
India's Internet bandwidth has been sliced in half, The Associated Press
reported, leaving its lucrative outsourcing industry trying to reroute
traffic to satellites and other cables through Asia.

Reports say that Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait and Bahrain are also experiencing severe problems.
Nations that have been spared the chaos include Israel -- whose traffic
uses a different route -- and Lebanon and Iraq. Many Middle East
governments have backup satellite systems in case of cable failure.

There were contradictory reports on the real cause behind the disruption,
but Du, a state-owned Dubai telecom provider, attributed it to an undersea
cable cut between Alexandria, Egypt and Palermo, Italy.

An official at Egypt's Ministry of Communications and Information
Technology, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was believed that a
boat's anchor may have caused the problems, although this was unconfirmed,
AP reported. He added that it might take up to a week to repair the fault.
Kuwait's Ministry of Communications said the problem could take two weeks
to solve, according to a statement carried by the state news agency, KUNA.
There were concerns in India that an Internet slowdown could affect trading
patterns at the country's two major exchanges, the National Stock Exchange
(NSE) in Delhi and the SENSEX exchange in Bombay.

Rajesh Chharia, president of India's Internet Service Providers'
Association, explained that some firms were trying to reroute via Pacific
cables and that companies serving the eastern US and the UK were worst
affected, AP added.

Besides the Internet, the outage caused major disruption to television and
phone services, creating chaos for the UAE's public and private sectors.
The Du internal memo, obtained by CNN, called the situation in Dubai
"critical" and stated that the cable's operators did not know when services
would be restored.

"This will have a major impact on our voice and Internet service for all
the customers," the memo stated. "The network operation team are working
with our suppliers overseas to resolve this as soon as possible."

The outage led to a rapid collapse of a wide range of public services in a
country which proudly promotes itself as technological pioneer.
Sources from Emirates Airlines confirmed to CNN Arabic that the outage did
not affect its flight schedules -- a statement which assured hundreds of
travelers worried after rumors about the possibility of rescheduled flights
due to the faults.

However, Dnata, a government group in charge of providing air travel
services in the Middle East and ground handling services at Dubai
International Airport, acknowledged facing problems because of the outage,
sources from its technical department confirmed to CNN Arabic.

The outage heavily crippled Dubai's business section, which is heavily
reliant on electronic means for billions of dollars' worth of transactions
daily.

Wadah Tahah, the business strategies and development manager for
state-owned construction company EMAAR, told CNN Arabic that it was
fortunate the outage started Wednesday, when there had been only moderate
activity in the UAE markets. He said that softened the blow to business
interests.

But Tahah warned that if the outage continued, "such a situation could
create problems between brokers, companies, and investors due to loss of
control."
