Is anyone already aware of any AT&T impairments out of Chicago?

I have a 2xT1 service out of chcgilcl AR5 that is maxing out at about
50% utilization.  Lots of users are trying to pull flows from lotsa
different places and they all seem to have a common bottleneck up-stream
from our specific 2xT1 service access point.

AT&T's MIS support recording says there are no known impairments at this
time.

Our NOC guys were told there is a fiber outage in Tampa.  We have a few
circuits down in Miami.

There is also a Verizon Fiber cut in SE Mass (Taunton?) - some repair
estimates are 36-48 hours.

So far it looks like anything that peers with AT&T is having the problem. 
We have another Internet link via Sprint and it's working just fine.

There was a similar problem with google.com from the NE a few weeks ago. 
I think I remember hearing that Google re-routed the traffic through
another transit AS as a workaround. Wonder if this is a similar issue...

It was affecting the southeast too... 

Somebody must have just rebooted something... cause it seems to be back
to normal now (if you can consider that new logo normal) ;-)

We're seeing a number of issues with WorldNIC nameservers failing

anyone was seeing similar problems.

We're seeing issues with:
ns47.worldnic.com (domain: cpurocket.com)

ns87.worldnic.com (domain insightcollect.com)
ns88.worldnic.com (domain insightcollect.com)

Anyone else seeing these failures?  WorldNIC does a lot of

Message-ID: <20061019184613.GA72209@icarus.home.lan>

At about 11:05 PDT (GMT-0700), there appears to be some sort-of
fibre cut on the East coast, particularly affecting Virginia <->
Washington D.C. fibre.

At least one provider (Abovenet) has confirmed this.  We've no idea
who the transit/fibre provider is.

Anyone have details?

Yes.  There appears to be a fibre cut of some kind either around
Virginia or Washington DC.  outages at isotf.org may be a better place
to discuss.

hmm....no wonder when i tried calling into sunrocket (as gblx peers w/

Yeah, some skript kiddies with an IOS exploit were causing BGP flaps.

Not really - but if there were, that would be almost the only way it could
be on-topic for full-disclosure.

I don't suppose you have anything more specific to go on, like an actual
traceroute or something?  Or other data that explains why you think it's
Time Warner rather than their up/downstream?

We ran into similar attacks (couple days back) coming from non-spoofed
address range (being initiated from valid prefixes).

In working (w/ a co-worker of mine) on a network attack situation (trace
process) for a 30,000 user location (serving 60 other school districts)
running BCP38 & rate-limit which got ddos'd w/ about 8mpps.
It appears that these attacks were coming from the inside which not only
saturated devices along its way but also got amplified into several
other networks also causing significant flaps to its peered connection
(OC-xx).
Besides being distracted with this incredible among of traffic flow our
goal number one goal was to prevent this bleeding, thanks to the
distributed monitoring sensors (maybe we got lucky) we were able to
identify and sink-hole (null route) certain blocks (vlans) while we
worked with the network/desktop team to isolate the infected machines.
This was certainly a hair-pulling experience.

The point that I'm trying to make here is, you can have data coming from
a herd of comprised hosts (bots, self-propagating worms,
spam-relays,fake http get request, backdoors, etc) that can attack
against a well-protected system(s) so any kind of defense mechanism
can/will get defeated.

Then again, it doesn't mean one wouldn't want to follow well practiced
prevention methods.

Just curious, any ddos vendors want to share their success stories :-)

The network hardware vendors do need to include the feature to support
BCP-38.  It'll help us out on a number of fronts especially with some of
the recent cyber attacks.

We're in process of reaching out to many of the companies and many
providers to encourage the implementation of BCP-38.  We've gotten a lot
of great feedback from many of you and its greatly appreciated.  You
know who you are :)
Especially some of the feedback related to the hardware OS issues.

Even better would be the option: "no ip bcp38"

Make it so a conscious action is needed to disable it, but PLEASE put
that in the release notes so when the config doesn't "change" we know
that something really did change... :)

Seems to be all cleared up now. I had a couple of my customers even
try to pull up their home site and could not get to it.

For FYI :) I realize that ICMP is not the best way to test and it is
not a true indication of slowness or the presence of a problem.

I'm a current customer of ELI at 2 locations.  I haven't had any issues
today but if I do I'll open a ticket and see if I can find out whats
going on.
