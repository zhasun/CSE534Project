Anyone else seeing problems with at&t Ethernet access in Chicago far north suburbs. We are seeing problems with multiple carrier connection across multiple Cos. There are delivered on at&t ehternet. Specifically, we see total loss of traffic for 26 seconds to over 1 minute. This is occurring at 30-60 minute intervals.

Subject: [outages] Level3 not reaching AWS / Netflix in Southwest with IPv6
Message-ID: <CAD6AjGSpV3C388M7uLOe0=GjQ=bTjrMT4HwidFq2Q4zFCLdG5g@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I posted a ticket with Level3 on this issue, wondering if others are seeing
the same thing

Using the Level3 looking glass in Chicago i can ping the
www.netflix.com at 2620:108:700f::36f5:7e0f
-- which is hosted on AWS

See image https://imgur.com/cROsraJ

But i cannot ping the same IPv6 address from the Level3 Phoenix looking
glass site, which lines up with the issues i see in the southwest on Level3
IPv6

https://i.imgur.com/0AhUqnO.png

Hopefully someone at Level3 can resolve this issue soon.

This Level3 outtage seems to be very broad

Here their LG can reach Wikipedia in Denver

But they cannot reach wikipedia in Miami

In Miami, Level3 also cannot reach www.he.net

but they can reach www.he.net in NYC

We had a service outage yesterday that rides across an AT&T circuit on the
last mile. Our site is west of Chicago.

Nothing conclusive this morning from AT&T about the reason for the outage.

The destination has 0(zero) loss, what you are pointing out is hops prior to the destination showing loss. Most likely what you are seeing is some sort of ICMP deprioritization, which is a standard practice for many isp.

I'm a Verizon customer and from home between 5:16pm to about 5:41pm I had no connection to various services 
HE.net and various other places. I'm in Media, PA.  All good now.

At about 5:06pm we completely lost connectivity to Verizon via Telia. We since routed Verizon through NTT and we are now seeing 70ms+ latency in Verizons network. One of our end users is reporting problems reaching twitter and other sites from their NJ FIOS. Anyone else seeing problems?

fine): https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2015-March/007661.html

A colleague of mine on Verizon FiOS in NY reported to me the exact same
problems as being reported here.  In other words: it wasn't just you.

VZ has been having some interesting issues the past few months.  Maybe the last of the UUNet people finally left. :)

Has this cleared up for folks?  I have one customer who reported issues reaching Verizon Toronto via Level 3 around the time when it was first reported here (just after 5pm EDT).  I?m waiting for confirmation that the issue has cleared for them; I don?t see it myself from the same ASN as the customer who reported the problem, but I figured I?d ask anyway.

I work for a company that services VOIP phones in the Philly/South Jersey
area. We saw a various ammount of Verizon FioS/IDE connections lose the
ability to route to vendors on various places on the internet around this
time. We failed the ones we could over to a back up connection and
corrected issues. Suspected higher end routing change/issue.

Not for me...I keep trying to access some of my google docs and I get 
the message below...I don't think it's an actually link connectivity 
problem, but an issue with google docs in general.

We are seeing a wave down between 1950 Stemsons FWY, Dallas to 56 Marietta in Atlanta, GA. The waves goes thru Nashville.

XO is saying span failure between Little Rock, AR and Memphis, TN.

Assuming it's a fiber cut.

To be clear, Windstream is totally out *for you*, not for Nashville?

How many eyeball networks are actually set up to execute that request

I guess I can see a reason to have some sort of mass refresh feature but I've never heard of anyone or anyplace having something like that set up.

While they aren't technically eyeball networks, applying a cache flush at
these two links will affect a double-digit percentage of eyeballs:

This would be a nice feature/framework to have. I work for a service that
is a membership based website that Realtors use for their business and a
number of months ago we had an issue where a few of our URL?s were cached
with the incorrect IP address. Our TTL was 3 hours but it was not
respected and these incorrect URLs had a TTL of 1 week. OpenDNS gives you
the ability to request a DNS cache flush, but trying to deal with the
various ISPs to get them to flush that DNS cache was far far worse than
pulling teeth with no anesthetic. Only a couple were helpful and even
understood what I was requesting, but most hadn?t the slightest clue what
I was talking about.

It is rare, but some times things happen and it would be helpful to have
some method to be able to flush DNS cache on servers who have incorrect
data stored in their cache.

That?s my 2 cents.

Eduard Tieseler

Subject: [outages] Problem between Level3 (TW Telecom) and ATT near Los
	Angeles?
Message-ID: <55108AF3.4020003@kenweb.org>

I've noticed an increase in latency and packet loss between two 
locations near the Los Angeles area.  One has a TW Telecom fiber based 
connection and the other an ATT DSL line.
The latency between two location used to be ~30ms and now is about 
~60ms.  Based on mtrs (See below) I'd say the ATT DSL line is the 
culprit for the packet loss issue.  If the traceroutes rDNS is accurate 
it seems TW Telecom use Level3 to reach ATT (as expected). However it 
seems that Level3 goes to Dallas to reach ATT.  That seems strange.  I 
would assume Level3 and ATT would peered in Los Angeles.

Level3 looking glass confirms that 107.128.0.0/12 is learned in Dallas 
from ATT from the point of view of Level3's LA router.

Just as an additional data point, in the Philadelphia Metro area I saw a 33 minute outage of Comcast Business Class,

earlier this morning starting EXACTLY 1:30 am Eastern to 2:03 am Eastern.

Because of the precision of the start time, and duration, I assumed it might be some kind of maintenance activity.

*** CASCADED EXTERNAL NOTES 25-Mar-2015 23:15:29 GMT From CASE: 9045140 - Event

The IP NOC has reported that traffic transiting high speed links on a device in Cleveland, OH made an intermediate-hop routing change to use a low speed link instead, which created congestion and caused customers to become impacted. The low speed routing link was removed to correct the issue, and service restoral has been verified with affected customers. No further impact is anticipated, and the IP NOC is currently auditing the network to ensure that this condition does not exist elsewhere."

I've noticed an increase in latency and packet loss between two
locations near the Los Angeles area.? One has a TW Telecom fiber based
connection and the other an ATT DSL line.
The latency between two location used to be ~30ms and now is about
~60ms.? Based on mtrs (See below) I'd say the ATT DSL line is the
culprit for the packet loss issue.? If the traceroutes rDNS is accurate
it seems TW Telecom use Level3 to reach ATT (as expected). However it
seems that Level3 goes to Dallas to reach ATT.? That seems strange.? I
would assume Level3 and ATT would peered in Los Angeles.

Level3 looking glass confirms that 107.128.0.0/12 is learned in Dallas
from ATT from the point of view of Level3's LA router.

Anyone know of an outage? I have 20+ customers with business cable within
somerset/mercer county (central NJ) down with no internet and traces to
their IP ranges from outside appear to die early in comcast's core in NYC
of PHILA. From one comcast circuit thats up in PA we cant even reach any of
these nj customers statics even within internal comcast <-> comcast routes.

Just as an additional data point, in the Philadelphia Metro area I saw a 33 minute outage of Comcast Business Class,

earlier this morning starting EXACTLY 1:30 am Eastern to 2:03 am Eastern.

Because of the precision of the start time, and duration, I assumed it might be some kind of maintenance activity.
