Subject: [outages] HE fremont IPv6 tunnel down
Message-ID: <4E0E3E2A.6030502@mompl.net>

I noticed I had no IPv6 connectivity and according to 
http://tunnelbroker.net/status.php the IPv6 tunnel tserv3.fmt2 in 
Fremont, CA is down.

Does anyone have an idea when it went down and when it's expected to be 
up again?

Thanks,
Jeroen

Status is showing as up now, and my tunnel through that same tunnel server
is up and working fine.

They're having hardware issues with that tserv, according to a post on
the forum.  They've been working on it.

Thanks.
It was up for a while, then went down again. Accordingly the status went 
back to up and is now down again. I'll just wait and see.

A heads up -

There is currently a TWTelecom outage since 7AM Pacific time.  I was 
told by my co-location ISP that this issue is national.

If you have more information, please share.

Thanks,

Our peer connection to TW Telecom (AS4323) in Irvine, CA seems to be up 
and we are sending/receiving routes with no issue.

Anyone traversing Global Crossing's JFK1.gblx.net interchange seeing any

VT, CA, CO, TX, FL) all getting 6-11% packet loss when
hitting/traversing that area.

There appears to be a login issue at Netflix.  Calls to their 1-866-579-7113 number only yields a recording that they are experiencing a higher than normal call volume, try again later.  Widespread?

Looks like they fixed it in the last 30 seconds to me.  Home page was timing
out but is now operating normally (though a bit slow).

I'm not having any issues myself -- however, I cache my authentication
credentials in a cookie, so I'm not prompted for authentication when
visiting the site.  I imagine if I logged out / nuked the cookie then
tried to log in I'd see the failure.

New PC that has no cookie with Netflix is unable to log in.  I'm not 100%
sure that I have the correct password but I am confident enough to say there
looks to be an authentication issue.

Not sure if it's related, but access to the website ipv6.netflix.com timed
out around 7:36, 7:41, and 8:02 pm, which is atypical.

Not seeing the advertisement at all from any peering partner I've

Did anyone just experience a 6-8 minute outage on their Level3 Service in
the Denver market? This was from 13:54 to 14:02 (20:54 to 21:02 UTC)
according to my traffic monitoring. I called customer care, and got someone
that could barely speak English, who just told me "No problem".

Same here in L.A.  We had a backup system that hiccup'd this morning
so I brought it down manually to do some work on it.  I brought it
back up and a warning page saying that it had recovered hit my phone
at 7:15 AM PDT, but the initial page (from 2 hours earlier) saying
that it was down didn't show up until 8:00 AM PDT.  I will test and
see if the page.att.net funnel has a different level of service.

No guaranteed or timely delivery of SMS, just like email. In the uk
getting the a txt many hours after it was sent isn't that uncommon

There's no guarantee, but we've found that sending SMS via a cell modem
is much more reliable than the various email gateways (and still works
when the problem is the local switch or router and SMTP can't get out).

Agreed.  The small monthly fee you'll pay for a SMS or data-only plan 
and the cost of a serial/USB cell modem are well worth it.  You don't 
even have to worry about who has what cell provider when sending from an 
SMS-capable device.  All of the email-to-SMS provider gateways are 
pretty much garbage with varying restrictions on length and content.  We 
even ran into providers which provided multiple SMS gateways (by 
multiple A records, for example), each having slightly different policies.

Google says maybe back in 2008-2009.

What year is it where you are?

I've been using Chrome (on Ubuntu) on Facebook forever with no issues

A traceroute would be more useful than ping in this situation,
especially since the TTL is reaching 118 (!!!).  Routing loop anyone?

A friendly reminder that the outages list is for reporting of problems with "major communications infrastructure components having significant traffic-carrying capacity." The current discussion probably belongs on another list.

Many of us forward this list traffic to our phones and appreciate keeping messages to a minimum.

Yes.  :-)

REMINDER: when responding to messages posted to outages@, please try to keep
your replies limited to "Yes, I'm seeing that too", "No, working fine here",
and other things similarly suitable to being sent to 10,000 cellphones.

If you need to expand, move the thread to outages-discussion@ (which, I
understand, is easier with some mailers than others; Zimbra won't let
me put in a reply-to header manually at all, so I feel your pain).

Thank you; this was a recording.

Cheers,

Reachable by me.  I see routes from XO and GBLX.  The XO path is preferred from my perspective (via Chicago).  I'm in western NY.  I traced to 81.26.208.1 as a test without a problem.

We see it fine from here via multiple upstreams/peering connections
(AS11666/Toronto area) - but not specifically through Level(3)

Looks like we have some goofy filters that seem to have caught this so

No problems here (AS12859), I see many paths via several IX'es and transits, IP's in the subnet are pingable. 28 boxes in ring.nlnog.net say it's reachable as well.

That'd be one of our subnets, you can mail me directly if you need to do 
some direct troubleshooting.
I have no outages reported by our customers

If anyone has a touch point with qwest, it looks like rackspace's IPv6 is largely broken due to what I suspect is the same issue.  We are unable to reach www.rackspace.com and apps.rackspace.com from locations in the Ashburn, VA area which transit Qwest (which is one of Rackspace's upstreams).

Too bad you didn't tell me before our prefixes were withdrawn from Qwest,
else we could have checked the same. (BCCing some rackspace.com folk).

yeah, I realized it significantly after my e-mail to you earlier.  Rackspace's frontline has so far been hesitant to accept this as an issue they should be bringing up with Qwest instead saying we should be contacting our ISPs.

Further impeding troubleshooting is the fact that the nameservers listed as authoritative for 2001:4801::/32 are timing out:

Can anyone else confirm?  It's like our /32 stopped propagating to some

Indeed - the two locations I have seen the broknness to Rackspace from are Hurricane Electric and TWTC in the Ashburn area (Reston and Falls Church, respectively).  These are also where I observed issues reaching your prefix earlier but no other problems have yet been observed.

Yes, there's definitely some issues with our IPv6 transit traffic through Qwest.  We've filtered off announcements to/from Qwest.  Hurricane Electric was still using Qwest though, with Qwest (attempting to) use Internap to get to us.  So, we've had tofilter off Internap as well.

This definitely points to an issue within Qwest's network, so we've opened a ticket with them to get this resolved.

Level3 had an issue between LA and Dallas at 1pm.  Apparently large amounts
of traffic from San Diego head through Dallas so it appeared at a whole
Internet drop.

We saw issues sending to destinations in LA and DFW over level3.

Appears to have cleared now.

Level3 had an issue between LA and Dallas at 1pm.  Apparently large amounts

We saw a core router drop out around 3 Central here in Chicago.  
Couldn't get anywhere beyond it from multiple providers.
