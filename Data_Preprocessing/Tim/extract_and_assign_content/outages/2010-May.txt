Anyone on level 3 for IP transit see an outage just now?  Our sites in Dallas and LA were unable to communicate with customers when taking level 3 as the best path.

Hi,

I'm guessing this has nothing to do with theplanet.com experiencing
network outages (starting last night) which is affecting their Dallas
and Houston facilities.

Please ignore this e-mail if this has not relationship with what you've
been experiencing, sorry.


regards,

Major qwest outage. Qwest engineers do not have an ETA yet, but techs are supposidly onsite working on the problem. Auto ticket generation is lagging because of size of outage. no master/global ticket number.

It's back for everyone now. The incident report is here:

Apparently something to do with android calendar synchronization
overloaded the system for 53 minutes.

Ummmmm....that seems to be talking about 4/28/2010.

It is 5/6/2010 (approximately) in this time zone.  About 6 or 8 days
have subsequently elapsed.  Approximately.

What am I missing?

Calling it from T-Mobile in East Michigan (734), I get "<SIT Tones> Your
call could not be completed as dialed. Please check the number and dial
again. 044T" On a second call, I got a similar message, but with code 098T.

Calling it via Qwest in East Michigan, the call seems to go through but all
I hear are several clicks (like an old fashioned supervision test line) and
then silence.

Calling via Voicepulse (VoIP handoff on nyc server), the call goes through
and I get your recorded announcement.

"we are unable to complete your call ... message 12 switch 562" from my

098T and 044T are NSNs (telco switch error/trailer codes).  The error
message looks like an AT&T 4ESS error message, but I'd have to hear it
to be sure.  For AT&T:

044T = Lansing, Michigan
098T = Toledo, Ohio

Additionally, calling from an AT&T wireless phone in East MI (734) gets a
reorder. Call went through on a second attempt though.

Maybe all the circuits are busy due to all the [outages] members calling
the test number ;-)

I get through OK from XO in Detroit, Michigan. I think I might have sent
that to the original poster already by direct email so sorry if this is
a dupe.

The name is self-explanatory, and it can be a great way to track and to

I think this is as good an idea as the outages@ list was when Vicky 
first thought of it and wasn't sure whether to pursue it, and I'd 
support any action to create it, once again.

Since you said "upcoming", I am going to assume you mean planned outages, maintenances, etc.  If that is wrong, please correct me.

How do you pare it down to something useful?  If every network, or even 10%, hell 1% of the networks world-wide put data in there, every day will be a solid block of multiple outages in every time slot.

You could organize by geography, perhaps even by country, which would help.  But the fire-hose of data regarding planned outages would be insane.

Valid points, and much about scalability and parse-ability. I think this 
should be taken off-list anyway, I will once again bow before Vicky to 
lead this, as he would be best for the job.

I'm sorry Patrick, but I think that you just are not thinking big  
enough (and considering the health of the system as a whole) --  
millions of folks rely on the Internet EVERY DAY and I don't think  
that we should just be limiting ourselves to planned outages...

We should be focusing on the unplanned outages, and making sure that  
we note them on the calendar at *least* a week before they occur, and  
preferably much further in advance than that -- some of us (and you  
are included in this) have large networks to deal with, and we need as  
much advance warning as possible for unplanned outages.

Wow, yeah, that would be cool, and would allow the large players to  
schedule their unplanned outages so that they don't overlap in a  
particular geography..

Well, I just did a telnet test:

[root at benjamin ~]# telnet mx03.bis.na.blackberry.com 25
Trying 216.9.248.34...
Connected to mx03.bis.na.blackberry.com (216.9.248.34).
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.

No discernable delay on close.  So apparently at least *some* Blackberry 
incoming MXs are broke.  Improperly thinking I'm on a blacklist, and dropping
the connection without telling me why is a valid value for "broke".

Is there a format back-end contact for RIM for such problems, anyone?

Yet it does seem that's the kind of "broke" that is occurring.   I'm seeing
a 100% success rate in connecting from a datacenter IP, and 100% failure
rate (with the same symptoms you've described) from a cable modem IP.

I believe the RIM BIS front-end boxes are IronPorts, so checking your IP's
SenderBase score would be a good place to start (http://senderbase.org)

I thought I'd folo'd to the list on this, but I don't see it.

I was on CBL for some reason; no other lists.  I don't see any daemon spam 
coming out through my firewall, but, for some reason, I wasn't dropping it.

I am now.

Problem solved, and I've added another useful lookup tool to the outages.org
dashboard; MXtools, who were nice enough to tweet about it, so, more eyeballs.

Cheers,

We saw a huge hit earlier in Denver (around 9:20am) through Level3, but only
partially dropped our traffic. (about 1/3 was still available)

Yes, we saw a temporary blip on our Level3 at that same time. Our BGP
session to them did not drop, but various sites were blackholed while
things were reconverging.

We had many customer complaints and all our  IP SLA tests spiked between 1110 and 1135 est for Level 3 in our Denver market.  But we also saw the problems in DAL on our level 3 peer (SLA test as well). Some event happened in the Denver area on level 3, we have opened a ticket with them and they reported to us they have had a lot of customer call in for the same thing. They have not given us an RFO yet...

An internal source has informed me there was an issue with a Data Center in
the Denver area in which something ?blew up? and this caused a chain effect
with anything going through Denver to any other pop in the USA.

The problem since has been resolved and was for a very short period.

Piker.  I had 238 queued by the time the CBL cleared me and RIM noticed.  

And I was in line at the Arby's with my phone across the restaurant on a
table.  Oops.

An internal source has informed me there was an issue with a Data Center in the Denver area in which something "blew up" and this caused a chain effect with anything going through Denver to any other pop in the USA.

The problem since has been resolved and was for a very short period.

We had many customer complaints and all our  IP SLA tests spiked between 1110 and 1135 est for Level 3 in our Denver market.  But we also saw the problems in DAL on our level 3 peer (SLA test as well). Some event happened in the Denver area on level 3, we have opened a ticket with them and they reported to us they have had a lot of customer call in for the same thing. They have not given us an RFO yet...

Subject: [outages] Extended outage at Vitelity / XO?
Message-ID: <6177EBA6-ED4B-41CE-A6A5-ADE79969809C@cernio.com>

Hi, folks,

All 30 of the DIDs I have at one of VOIP providers, Vitelity.net, have been offline for more than 8 hours as of this writing.

Vitelity quickly acknowledged the problem, and are characterizing this as a "global DID outage" at XO Communications, affecting "over 100,000 of [Vitelity's] DIDs alone and many others throughout [XO's] network."    Now, I know major outages happen, and service with Vitelity has been generally good, but 8 hours and counting is pretty awful.

I'm worried that this may in fact be a contract dispute of some kind between Vitelity and XO.

Can anyone else confirm Vitelity's report of widespread outages with XO?

thanks,

Graham Freeman

Hello,

I just tested one of our Vitelity DIDs and calls are going through just
fine, so the issue might be fixed now.

We received a notice from iCall about this as well since they use XO DIDs
too, so I don't think it's directly related to Vitelity alone. iCall was
sending out emails with XO notices in them starting at 7:15pm EDT with no
projected fix time in sight at the time. Here is the content of the iCall
email(at least they proactively notified customers unlike Vitelity):


"2010-05-20 9:53PM EST - XO technicans have been unable to remedy the issue
in the projected timeline. We are awaiting further updates.
2010-05-20 8:48PM EST - XO technicans are on-site and have provided an
estimated resolution time of 30 minutes.
2010-05-20 7:15PM EST - XO Communications, one of our primary inbound DID
providers, is currently experiencing a major equipment outage. This outage
is affecting many of our US inbound DIDs.

Starting at approximately 7PM EST, we have been experiencing an impairment
with many of our inbound DIDs due to an issue with XO Communications, one of
our vendors. Their primary switching equipment in Dallas is currently
experiencing an outage. We have escalated this to the highest levels of the
organization, but the on-site technicians do not yet have an estimated time
to repair."


We do have DIDs on several carriers including some through XO, but luckily
for us, most of them are not on XO.

All of my Exchange (BIS and AS) have been fine. Their CS is really excellent
though as I'm sure you know.3-5 min reponse from ticket submission to
response in my experience (the live chat isn't bad either on more complex
issues.

Sorry to dredge up an old issue, but did anyone get anything better than "PEBKAC".

We were having some issues with voice that was going to Level3 last Tuesday and trying to figure out if what you all saw was related or not (I use Level3 for transit and voice termination), but since I didn't open a ticket at the time (we thought it was an internal issue), Level3 says they can't research the issue.

Any help?

-Sean

We have a ticket open.

MTR between our network (level 3 customer) and another network (level 3 
customer) was showing that ae-1-100.ebr2.Denver1.Level3.net was running 
50%-90% packet loss for the past 6+ hours.  Well, that doesn't really 
tell the whole story since routers routinely drop ICMP as a matter of 
due course during periods of high load.  But, point to point pings to 
far end destinations that would normally be 40-60ms were varying 
regularly (every 60 seconds) to 240-260ms.  And, of course the voice 
calls on that path sounded like crap.

What it looks like is a router that is experiencing consistently high 
CPU load that is chewing on some process every 60 seconds.  That 
explains the MTR packet loss numbers that are probably innocuous.  But, 
while the processor is chewing on that process, the throughput latency 
goes through the roof.  This is a very common thing that we have seen 
before . . . just not in the middle of the Level3 network.

The Level3 tech said that since he could not replicate the problem, he 
would leave the ticket open until tomorrow.

Message-ID: <4BFB686B.6040508@west.net>

We just lost connectivity to numerous DSL circuits in central California
within seconds of each other, multiple DSLAMs in multiple COs.  I'm
having trouble reaching anyone at Verizon that understands and/or cares.
 They want to open trouble tickets on each DSL phone number wit ha
24-hour response.

Anyone else having the same issue?  Anyone who has a working Verizon
number in VADI/ATM department that is open 24/7?

Tracked down the right group, service was restored as of 08:30 PDT.  No
RFO as yet.  Apparently the outage was limited to Santa Maria and Lompoc
areas of southern California.

It seems that mediatemple.net and sites for which they serve DNS have
been down for 30 minutes or so. Their twitter claims that it seems to
be a DNS misconfiguration and that the servers are not actually down.

Can you point to a scholarly discussion on the differences (and how to
make them visible) between outage-broken, not-outage-broken,
outage-not-broken, and not-outage-not-broken suitable for display to
whiny customers?

Subject: [outages] ATT wireless LA-area outage
Message-ID: <39CEDBD4-17E2-4DA5-8C65-4BF52D56436A@gmail.com>

looking for details - just received word of an unspecified ATT outage  
in the LA area that may cause interruptions in cellular phone coverage  
(in the event this represents a departure from your typical ATT  
wireless service :))

anybody have further details? our corp IT folks were frustratingly  
short on specifics (other than the obvious "may affect BlackBerry  
users")

thanks,
/sf

as somebody more observant pointed out, LA can mean many things - Los  
Angeles, in this case.

Nothing official but I was in the area (San Fernando Valley - Van Nuys)
and had good 3G data but no voice service.  Initially good signal
strength but an intercept stating call could not be completed at this
time, then went to no bars strength and "out of range".  3G data
continued to work throughout.  Timeframe roughly 1530 to 1700 PDT.
Cleared up shortly thereafter or I drove out of the affected area
(northbound 101 towards Ventura).

thanks, Jay. I got confirmation yesterday that BB email delivery was  
also affected, and that the situation appears to have been resolved  
now (email has begun flooding in again).

(I'm out around Thousand Oaks and had no interruptions in mail or data  
on an ATT iPhone, but didn't check on voice.)
