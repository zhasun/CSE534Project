Hackers Attack Key Net Traffic Computers
- - By TED BRIDIS, Associated Press Writer
Tuesday, February 6, 2007
(02-06) 15:09 PST WASHINGTON, (AP) --

Hackers briefly overwhelmed at least three of the 13 computers that
help manage global computer traffic Tuesday in one of the most
significant attacks against the Internet since 2002.

Experts said the unusually powerful attacks lasted as long as 12
hours but passed largely unnoticed by most computer users, a
testament to the resiliency of the Internet. Behind the scenes,
computer scientists worldwide raced to cope with enormous volumes of
data that threatened to saturate some of the Internet's most vital
pipelines.

The motive for the attacks was unclear, said Duane Wessels, a
researcher at the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis
at the San Diego Supercomputing Center. "Maybe to show off or just be
disruptive; it doesn't seem to be extortion or anything like that,"
Wessels said.

Other experts said the hackers appeared to disguise their origin, but
vast amounts of rogue data in the attacks were traced to South Korea.

The attacks appeared to target UltraDNS, the company that operates
servers managing traffic for Web sites ending in "org" and some other
suffixes, experts said. Officials with NeuStar Inc., which owns
UltraDNS, confirmed only that it had observed an unusual increase in
traffic.

Among the targeted "root" servers that manage global Internet traffic
were ones operated by the Defense Department and the Internet's
primary oversight body.

"There was what appears to be some form of attack during the night
hours here in California and into the morning," said John Crain,
chief technical officer for the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers. He said the attack was continuing and so was the
hunt for its origin.

"I don't think anybody has the full picture," Crain said. "We're
looking at the data."

Crain said Tuesday's attack was less serious than attacks against the
same 13 "root" servers in October 2002 because technology innovations
in recent years have increasingly distributed their workloads to
other computers around the globe.

AP Internet Writer Anick Jesdanun contributed to this story from New
York.

Weird,  right at that same time we lost access to AIM for 5 minutes.
Odd tho since we are in las vegas and I don't think those packets would
go through Montreal..  I'll have to do a traceroute after it comes back
up to see where those aim packets do go.

Word is savvis has a fiber cut from ATL to CHG of some sort and re-routing
things through Dallas.   Atleast that's what I've seen on traces.  Savvis
has confirmed an outage on the east coast just not sure exactly where and
what all it affects.

The Wikimedia Foundation servers are currently experiencing technical difficulties.

The problem is most likely temporary and will hopefully be fixed soon.
Please check back in a few minutes.

For further information, you can visit the #wikipedia channel on the Freenode IRC network.

In the meantime, you may be able to view Google's cached version of this page.

Wikipedia is now one of the most visited sites on the Internet by traffic and
continues to grow, and as a result the Wikimedia Foundation has a constant need
to purchase new hardware. If you would like to help, please donate.

Does anyone if there are any problems in Chicago with L3?  I have been
trying to chase down a problem with one of my vendors and found it could
possibly be an issue there.  I found major packet loss along with well over
2.5 seconds of latency.

 

this is the hostname that comes up for the troubled router:

It appears like L3 is having issues in San Diego. Something to do with
Quest, not 100% certain.

Does anyone have any further info?

This update (see below) relates to Hurricane Electric and not L3.

Sorry about the confusion.

Raman - Maybe we should change the subject to L3 issue

The card in slot 5 of that router has failed and has taken down the
router.  We are waiting on Equinix smart hands to get to the router to
pull the card, etc.  In the mean time we reboot the router.

In the future, you are welcome to contact noc at he.net or support at he.net
depending on the urgency.  We would be happy to help you.

I'm a L3 customer and I just got off the phone with one of their techs.
He says that "there is no fiber cut". There is however a router in the
san jose issue with some misbehaving cards that's causing some IGP
instability. Not sure how believable that really is, but that's what
they said.

I know Internap turned down their peering with L3 for about an hour
and just brought it back up because of L3 BGP issues but i'm not sure
that helps you :)

I saw a bunch of BGP churn on a DS3 into Level3(/WilTel) Anaheim
just after 12:00 PST. Haven't yet contacted them for any official
info.

Seems to mostly stable for the moment...

I was in Chicago all weekend and L3 has seen shoddy performance since Friday
evening. I keep a running ping back to my own router which hangs off of
Sprint-Link in Relay Maryland and ping response times have been up in the
quadruple figures. BGP seems to be the problem and hopefully we will all
have the speed we are paying for.
Be cool, Richard
