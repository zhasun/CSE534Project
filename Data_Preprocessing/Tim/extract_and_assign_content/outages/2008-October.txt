Nope.  I have equipment lax11 and a p2p HiCap to that same location, all
is well.  My stuff is verizon-business in Torrance if that makes a

Hi,

Just wondering if there's any interest in meeting up during nanog 44
(los angeles) and sharing your thoughts, challenges or your outages
experience in general or would like to simply vent and empty your head.


Topics of interest:

* Service provider(s) participation in outages notification?

* What monitoring  tools do you use to monitor your environment? How do
they work for your environment? Does it scale for your environment? What
would you like to see out of such a tool (open-source or commercial).

Collaboration/participation is one of the key things that I'm aiming to
achieve w/o the need for an overarching organizational body and have a
broad base of representation. So come and speak your mind.


Please respond to me directly and not the list so I can arrange for a
meeting room.


grateful thanks,


regards,

Hi All,

I wasn't able to connect to any Google sites (Docs, gmail, google.com,
etc.) this weekend that while connected via AT&T's 3G broadband card
here in the SF Bay Area. A colleague with another AT&T card is seeing
the same problems: can't connect to Google but can hit other sites
(Yahoo, craigslist, etc.).

Wondering if there's a peering problem with AT&T somewhere. Anyone have
a clue?

thanks,

Dig tells me that IP belongs to AT&T, but 12/8 told me that anyway.

I can't mtr to that IP, and tracing to Google from Road Runner Tampa Bay
doesn't cross it, but that's unsurprising.

If you're staff at Craigs, you probably carry enough water to look the AT&T 
NOC up on Jared's list and let them know that router's blocking Google from 
being accessible to their own 3G customers.  Including iPhone users.

Cheers,

They were down for about an hour, and back again as of about 14:30 
eastern.

We're seeing intermittent outages from InterNAP (pnap.net) to GBLX
(gblx.net) in the greater NYC area. I'm told GBLX techs are working on
the issue but I don't have a global ticket number.

Subject: [outages] Sprint/Cogent no longer peering
Message-ID: <490AC686.9050602@rollernet.us>

For those of you not on NANOG, Sprint and Cogent have stopped peering. 
If you only have connectivity through Sprint or Cogent, you're likely to 
find the other and their customers unreachable.
