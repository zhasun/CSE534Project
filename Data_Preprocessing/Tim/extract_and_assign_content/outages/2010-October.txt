Old info, but I saw it wasn't reported here and perhaps others received
reports yesterday and couldn't respond.

at about 10:20AM EST we noticed our response times/latency from all external
web sites we monitor (CNN, Google, MSN, etc.) go through the roof.  We
noticed also a ridiculous number/percentage of dropped packets (about 50-60%
to all these sites).  On hold with Verion now,(and I suspect I'll be on hold
for a while) but if anyone can enlighten me as to what happened, it'd be
greatly appreciated.

We had some complaints of packet loss to Google as early as Friday.
Traffic was taking our Verizon transit connection out of Philadelphia.
Latency appeared normal however. Loss was as high as 50%.

We peer directly with Yahoo and Microsoft so we didn't see any problem
there.

A ticket was opened with Verizon at some point and it was closed today
without any details. The problem appears resolved.

Circuits were back up around 12:30am. So it was 8 hour outage.

This was a City-wide event in Philly for XO, not sure how many  
circuits were effected. It is unclear what the cause or resolution was.

Is anyone else facing something similar?

I was receiving internal alerts for service degredation in both Bangalore

The Coimbatore alerts seem to have cleared early this morning (03:00 EST),
but I did not see the Bangalore alerts clear.

Please take 5 minutes to read it before you post [again].


General Information
===================

About Outages & Mission statement:
http://wiki.outages.org/index.php/Main_Page


Credits:
Credit goes to the Debian / NANOG mailing list for FAQ, which served as
a model for the OUTAGES FAQ.


Outages lists and AUP:
==========================================
Mailing List Charter

The OUTAGES mailing list is established to provide a forum for the
exchange of major outages discussion of Critical Internet
infrastructure, such as IXPs, DNS root servers, major carrier failures,
major data center, carrier hotel, COs, etc., that require cooperation
among network service providers, carriers and network operators around
the globe. In order to continue to provide a useful forum for discussion
of relevant outages issues, the list is governed by the following
guidelines:


Acceptable Use Policy (Code of Conduct)

Outages is entirely volunteer-run non-profit organisation. We 
collaborate freely on a volunteer basis for everyone's benefit.

This code of conduct covers your behaviour as a member of the Outages 
Community, in any outages mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, 
public meeting or private correspondence.

1. Discussion will focus on Internet / backbone related outages and
technical issues surrounding it as described in the charter of OUTAGES.
2. Postings of issues inconsistent with the charter are prohibited.
3. Cross posting is prohibited.
4. Do not quote messages that were sent to you by other people in
private mail, unless agreed beforehand.
5. Postings that include foul language, character assassination, and
lack of respect for other participants are prohibited.
6. Product marketing is prohibited.
7. Postings of political, philosophical, religious and legal nature are
prohibited.
8. Using list as source for private marketing initiatives is prohibited.
9. Autoresponders sending "out of office" or "vacation" mail either to
the list or to the poster are prohibited.
10. Try not to  flame; it is not polite.
11. Never send your messages in HTML; use plain text instead.
12. Do not send "test" messages to determine whether your mail client is
working.

Individuals who violate these guidelines will be contacted and asked to
adhere to the guidelines.

If groups of individuals persist in introducing topics that are outside
the charter of OUTAGES, the moderator committee will send a request to
the entire mailing list requesting adherence to the guidelines.


OUTAGES List FAQ:
===================================================
FAQ contributions are welcome -- please send email to admins at outages.org

About OUTAGES and the List

The primary goal of outages mailing list is for outages-reporting that
would apply to failures of major communications infrastructure
components having significant traffic-carrying capacity.

See the main OUTAGES web page at:
http://www.outages.org

The OUTAGES Volunteer Committee is made up of network operator community
members. You can reach the committee at admins at outages.org


A. Is the list moderated?
No, the outages mailing list is not moderated.

B. I am not getting any mail anymore from the list! Is it down or what?

* If for any reason your email address is unavailable, after some
retries you will be automatically unsubscribed.
* You may get unsubscribed because MTAs relaying traffic to you get
bounces for some reason.
* There are no major outages to report :-)

C. How do I report outages regarding outages mailing list?
You could report problem(s) by reaching us at, admin at outages.org

D. Subscribe / Unsubscribe to OUTAGES Mailing List

The survey has a few question / answer pairs which do not seem to make sense.  For instance:

Q: Do you have concerns about sharing details (lesson learned) regarding your company outages?
A: Yes (we believe in transparency)
If you believed in transparency, why would you have concerns about sharing lessons?

During a critical outage of your infrastructure that results in public-visible outages, updates (internal/external) are provided by your Network Operations or is there a special group for outages closure / notification?
Does that question even make sense?  I'm guessing you meant to ask "ARE updates provided by your NOC...".  And there is no way to say "no, provided by a specific group outside Operations".

Other than those, I tried to fill out the survey.  Looking forward to the results.

Subject: [outages] llnw/dtag suboptimal routing
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=4evav+DGJfFRdkM_iGdsYz=OxfoiZ+5POv7-P@mail.gmail.com>

Just as I was about to send this, things seemed to have normalized.
 Throughout most of this morning:
 Some domestic Limelight routes, normally routed through local peers, seemed
to only be available through DTAG (causing them to be routed to Europe).  A
minority of routes were affected:
