Are you sure it's not an outage? :)

[ Cross-posted to NANOG and Outages; replies to outages or outages-discussion;
I would set the header, but Zimbra sucks.  :-) ]

I've had my home box set to use 8.8.8.8 as its primary resolver, falling back
to the BBN anycast.

Sometime today, 8.8.8.8 appears to have stopped resolving www.noaa.gov and
www.nhc.noaa.gov:

though it resolves Yahoo and Google and Akamai.com and everything else
I throw at it.

Digging noaa.gov at 4.2.2.1 returns what I expect.

Interesting, too, that Firefox 5.0 wouldn't DTRT, even though 4.2.2.1-3 were
the backup nameservers in my resolv.conf.

Road Runner Tampa Bay connection.

Can anyone confirm or deny?  Google DNS or NOAA people here, before I go ping 
NOAA staff on Twitter?

Cheers,

Yeah; it was reliably broken all day, and of course, it's now fine here too.

Either someone at NOAA or Google saw that and applied a Magic Kick, or
I was just unlucky.

Sorry for the noise, folks.

We're seeing some trouble with a remote employee working on DSL
SBC/AT&T.  500ms access times, inability to get to major web services
like HostGator and more.  Anyone else seeing this?

Thanks!

Lack of data here isn't of much help.  You'd need to provide
mtr/traceroutes (both directions, not just from one endpoint!) for
starters.

There is no more SBC (they've been officially gone for a few years.  I
know because my workplace used to handle their primary source of IVR for
technical assistance, line debugging, etc. and they're long gone.  Have
you contacted AT&T?

This might also be of interest to you.  You will need to read all the
threads and hope end-users have taken the time to be diligent in their
statements/research (most are not):

http://www.dslreports.com/forum/ilec,pcb

I know dealing with AT&T is equivalent to David vs. Goliath.  Good luck.

Their DNS (along with a number of other high profiles sites) was
hacked/redirected.

Just worked find for me.  Traceroute times out somewhere in Georgia, I

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Recursive_and_caching_name_server

In other words, the web server is not down but the DNS records are broken.
To get around the broken part you can do as was suggested and etc your hosts

We lost touch with a customer remote site in Tampa on a Brighthouse
connection (24.227.73.170) about 25 minutes ago.  Calls to Brighthouse are
returning fast busies, the Brighthouse.com site is a mess from where we're
looking and we see nothing past what appears to be a Brighthouse edge router
in the Tampa area.

Anyone else seeing the same?

Confirmed Brighthouse outages in several locations in St Petersburg and
Tampa. We confirmed this with our colocation facility in Tampa as well.

Their phone lines here in Pinellas are all returning fast busy as well.

Thanks,

Yeah, they had an outage this morning for 30-45 minutes, around noon; I've

their CFL hub, for unobvious reasons).

Our office network service was restored around 2:41pm EST, but we are
still having latency issues even now (which isn't unexpected given
their rolling service restore going on right now).

Many others on Twitter are still reporting as down.

It sounds like they are working their way through it.

Rumors abound: lighting hit on their Brandon head-end, botched Cisco
IOS upgrades, Hub-27 hard-down in Auburndale this morning (from a
BrightHouse tech), reportedly impacting as far as Alabama if not
nationally, some folks have even gone so far as to report a recording
of a "National Security issue" when trying to reach their customer
support.

Honestly, without BrightHouse confessing and providing a root-cause
analysis, there is nothing factual to point to yet.

We have a few Akamai servers in our network that have been chugging around 200Mbps+ for years.  On or around the 27th of August they have almost completely stopped passing traffic.  The servers are fine, our BGP sessions are up, everything appears normal.  I've not heard anything from Akamai and emails into their NOC seems to indicate they don't know what is going on or they just don't want to say what's going on.

Regardless it's been a problem over a week now.  Has anyone (that hosts Akamai servers in their network) noticed the same thing?

We had a server lock up yesterday, and they were pretty anxious to get us to reboot it.

Same one has locked up 3 times so far this year.

Other than that, we still see lots of traffic.

Akamai's overall traffic is nominal.

If you have servers in your network and have any questions (about this or anything else), you can email NetSupport-tix at akamai.com.  That will open a ticket with Akamai's Network Support team.  They are M-F, not 24/7.

If you have an emergency, you can email noc at akamai.com, or call them at +1-617-444-3007, or toll free in North America at 1-877-625-2624.

If you forget the contact info, you can always find it at <http://www.akamai.com/peering/>, or <http://as20940.peeringdb.com/>.

Yes, all looks normal.  All prefixes are being sent and nothing has changed in several months.

A few replies off list have indicated that it might be an isolated issue to us, but it's just very strange that it's taking them over a week to address/fix this.  Their communications on the issue has been extremely poor.

San Diego Gas and Electric is saying on Twitter that "all" of their
customers are without power. Possibly through Friday. The website just
has a block of text that says:

"There?s a major power outage in the region. SDG&E crews are working as
quickly and safely as possible. We don?t have an estimated restoration
time. The power could be out through the night and into tomorrow. The
outage has affected street lights. Please drive safely and treat the
street lights as a four-way stop. If you have a personal family
emergency plan, please activate it now."

Seems to be fairly widespread.  outlook.com is also not resolving.

Both get as far as glb{1,2}.glbdns.microsoft.com which successfully returns
an SOA for the domains, but nothing more.

We can confirm this outage, and yes it appears to be solely DNS-based.

It's affecting critical services such as Microsoft's VirtualEarth as
well as MSN Money.

I want to make it clear to folks: the power outages are specific to San
Diego and some (limited) surrounding counties.  The Bay Area / Silicon
Valley region, as well as "true" northern California, has not seen any
effects.  The power issue in southern California is limited to that
region.

Again, as for geographic location or technical details with regards to
the Microsoft DNS issue, I am not able to comment.

Hey,

We've been on the phone to Microsoft a few times today. They've admitted
that it's taken out a large part of their global infrastructure.

We had major issues with a POC for Office365 (onmicrosoft.com) along with
their other hosting.

Most of it seemed to be back online around 5AM GMT.

Is anyone aware of any potential problem with Level 3 routing between Florida to PHX?
Seems like there may be a problem somewhere in Dallas, but I have yet to confirmed.

I know they've had problems with car1.phx and traffic spikes causing routing protocols to bounce.  We routed around Level3 in Phoenix?

We were told it was a DDOS attack directed at one of their
larger customers (not us) in Phoenix.

Subject: [outages] Network failure causes credit union ATM card issues...
	SEATTLE
Message-ID: <4e73de86.0320440a.4697.ffffb421@mx.google.com>

http://www.komonews.com/news/local/129994183.html

According to a Boeing Employees Credit Union spokesperson, the COOP Network
Authentication is down, which is used to authenticate transactions for ATM
cards.

The outage affects all almost credit unions, since the COOP network is owned
by all credit unions in the U.S., the spokesperson said.

There is no estimate when service will be restored.

Anyone seeing major performance issues with Microsoft's MSDN CDN? I'm trying
to pull some content down, and the fastest we're able to get from any point
(office, Equinix POPs, etc) is 61.5kB/s-63kB/s.

I've had a similar experience (TechNet, but I'm sure the backend CDN is 
the same). I found that that the download speeds are significantly 
faster if you use Microsoft's download manager as opposed to just 
downloading the file through a web browser.

Of course, it could just be me... :)

Yep, last week I could not get anything from MSDN at over 20-60KB/s.  I have not tried again yet this week to see if it is still the case.

This was from our own address space on Cogent and Internap in Ashburn,VA.

Subject: [outages] GoDaddy DNS Issues?
Message-ID: <CANRxxNXDU+y30-VKCzpcXsnWog-a3jVYzaRNT6RX+3XFd6AQLA@mail.gmail.com>

We are receiving various reports from our customers (large
institutions) indicating that they cannot access our public facing
hosts via their FQDNs.  We use GoDaddy for DNS.

Initial troubleshooting shows that queries to ns50.domaincontrol.com
and ns49.domaincontrol.com fail from Windows based caching name
servers, however succeed on UNIX/Linux hosts.

Verification at our site using dig and nslookup confirms the above.

On a windows host the following is returned for all valid and invalid
domain names:
   *** ns50.domaincontrol.com can't find xyz.com: No response from server

Can anyone confirm what we are seeing?

Thanks and regards,
Mike

Do you have any details that you could share with me?  Offlist would be okay.

I cannot confirm this.  On Windows machines all I am seeing is that
lookups for xyz.com using an authoritative nameserver of
ns50.domaincontrol.com is -- correctly -- rejected:

PS>nslookup xyz.com ns50.domaincontrol.com
*** Can't find server name for address 208.109.255.25: Query refused
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  208.109.255.25

*** UnKnown can't find xyz.com: Query refused

I see the same behaviour with ns49.domaincontrol.com, ns48, etc...

The rejection message here is correct because xyz.com is not a domain
GoDaddy's nameservers are authoritative for (root servers as well as
WHOIS both confirm this; query a.gtld-servers.net for NS records for
xyz.com), and *are not* recursive nameservers.

I also see the exact same behaviour with dig on a FreeBSD host.  Note:
"status: REFUSED".

$ dig @ns49.domaincontrol.com ns xyz.com

; <<>> DiG 9.6.-ESV-R5 <<>> @ns49.domaincontrol.com ns xyz.com

Also, according to WHOIS domaincontrol.com is "Wild West Domains".  Is
this a company GoDaddy purchased?  I have not bothered to check web
pages (do not particularly care).  If not, what's the relation?

Any thoughts on the 'no response from server' error message vs a
'query refused' error message?

We are receiving various reports from our customers (large
institutions) indicating that they cannot access our public facing hosts via their FQDNs.  We use GoDaddy for DNS.

Initial troubleshooting shows that queries to ns50.domaincontrol.com and ns49.domaincontrol.com fail from Windows based caching name servers, however succeed on UNIX/Linux hosts.

Verification at our site using dig and nslookup confirms the above.

On a windows host the following is returned for all valid and invalid domain names:
   *** ns50.domaincontrol.com can't find xyz.com: No response from server

Can anyone confirm what we are seeing?

Thanks and regards,
Mike

Yes, it means DNS timeout or an ACL/network-level issue vs. getting back
an exclusive response from the query that says "I reject".

Are you using IPv6?  Can you turn off IPv6 to ensure that your
tunnelling provider isn't causing this?

This is networking troubleshooting 101, you should have folks on staff
or available via phone who should be able to help diagnose this problem.
Analysis of packet capture from each device up to your ISP should be
sufficient.

So where's the diagnostic and debugging data showing the problem?
Come on folks, this is pretty disheartening.

Anyone else seeing any issues going Comcast to Global Crossing this evening?  I was smack in the middle of some work on an EU server when it disconnected my ssh session.  Thought I broke it, however I cannot load the datacenter website from home.  From the office everything shows fine.  From home traceroute shows fail past 208.178.62.141 going to 78.129.136.0/24 or 79.129.226.0/24, and I cannot load http://ipstats.globalcrossing.net either.  Down for me says it's just me, but I cannot get to any of the affected services from one of my customer networks on Comcast either.

Not sure it is related, but there was a fairly major outage on Comcast
earlier today, around 13:30 - 18:30 local PDT.

Things got back to normal very quickly after that -- of course,
specking from a consumer perspective.

Are you absolutely certain this is the fault of GBLX?  Your traceroute
below is only one direction -- to get a clear picture you need
traceroutes from *both* directions; return packets may be taking an
entirely different route and that could be what's broken (and would
render as such in your traceroute).  Most of the time on the Internet
routing IS NOT symmetrical.  You're a network engineer though so I
assume you know this.

78.129.136.1 reachable from Comcast in the California Bay Area.  This
isn't shown in the below mtr because of what appears to be ACLs
somewhere near/around the border of the network shown below blocking
ICMP time exceeded.  These egress packets obviously don't use GBLX;
cannot check ingress, obviously.  ICMP echo/echo reply to the endpoint
does work.

Reminder to readers: the Internet is broken 24x7x365, and I'm quite
serious.  For mission-critical services that need maintenance, OOB
(out-of-band) is required.  If that means dialing internationally into a
modem in London to do some device config changes then that's what it
means.  Rock the POTS lines, don't be afraid.

Correct.  Getting to the other side has taken a bit of doing, however traceroutes coming back to my house don't come across GBLX, destination in 75.151.89.0/24.  Anything going from local comcast network to this remote location crossing gblx seems to fail.  From another server in denver over tinet, looks good (no gblx touching) and same from phoenix.  I'm not sure where the issue lies, just appears to me to from comcast destined to gblx, hense asking if anyone else sees something weird.

You are correct something is always broken, however OOB is not something that's justifiable in this case :)

This morning appears everything looks fine, and still crossing gblx, but not the same hop that was failing.  Thanks for the replies :)

Correct.  Getting to the other side has taken a bit of doing, however traceroutes coming back to my house don't come across GBLX, destination in 75.151.89.0/24.  Anything going from local comcast network to this remote location crossing gblx seems to fail.  From another server in denver over tinet, looks good (no gblx touching) and same from phoenix.  I'm not sure where the issue lies, just appears to me to from comcast destined to gblx, hense asking if anyone else sees something weird.

You are correct something is always broken, however OOB is not something that's justifiable in this case :)

Are you absolutely certain this is the fault of GBLX?  Your traceroute below is only one direction -- to get a clear picture you need traceroutes from *both* directions; return packets may be taking an entirely different route and that could be what's broken (and would render as such in your traceroute).  Most of the time on the Internet routing IS NOT symmetrical.  You're a network engineer though so I assume you know this.

78.129.136.1 reachable from Comcast in the California Bay Area.  This isn't shown in the below mtr because of what appears to be ACLs somewhere near/around the border of the network shown below blocking ICMP time exceeded.  These egress packets obviously don't use GBLX; cannot check ingress, obviously.  ICMP echo/echo reply to the endpoint does work.

I had a report of a GLBX routing issue last week from a network in Italy and have been trying
to track down a GLBX contact for days.

Could I get some traceroutes to 67.78.195.4?  I just moved some servers,
and I'm having "some people can hit them; some people can't" problems.

Offlist is fine; no sense cluttering it up.  Will report what comes about;
I'm pretty sure this is just an RR misconfig...

Nothing like asking for help to convince the problem to reveal itself.

Fixed now.  Thanks.

So I had to renumber some servers this afternoon, cause I was expanding to 
a larger netblock (a 28 instead of a 29).

I renumbered my servers and my DNS (which I'd set the TTL on to 300 like a
good boy on Wednesday), and then pulled the trigger with Road Runner.  He
"rescripted" his SMC router (the likely cause of some standard deviation noted
by a couple of reporters -- the router, not the rescripting), and I pinged
it and it was ok, and I mtr'd it and it was ok, so I hit the webserver,
and that came up fine, too.

So then my boss calls me 15 minutes later: it's not working.

"I wonder what that could be", sez I; I'd even traced and hit the webserver
from my Android phone (Sprint; Opera Mobile 11), and it had worked fine.

That was Red Herring #1.

So my boss uses a Mac.  So does my best friend, and while he was on the way
out the door to a second-anniversary-wake for a guy we went to school with,
he took a moment to try to hit it as well.  No luck.

That was Red Herring #2 (both of them use Macs).

Those of you who've been playing close, careful attention here may have
noticed by now the thing I did *not* say I'd done: 

Changing the default gateway on the server.

My office lan could hit it *because its uplink was in the same network*;
*it* had a route for that network.  Everyone else... couldn't.

Apparently, Sprint operates a caching server, even if you're using the 
version of Opera (Mobile, not Mini) that does *not*, which explains Red
Herring #1.

As for Red Herring #2, well... Macs don't, apparently, hard-cache IPs the
way WinXP does (I'm looking at *you*, "ipconfig/ flushdns"), but I already
knew that, because boss had the right address.

Lesson Learned: Make sure you know what your diagnostic tests are telling 
you, before you use them to rule out possible problems.  Better yet: don't
rule those potential problems out at all: work your whole diagnostic tree
every time

Oh: I forgot Red Herring #3: the traces that broke *didn't hit that carrier
edge router* for some reason.  No clue why.

Thanks to the dozen or so people who responded; a couple of whom have
way too {much time,many servers} on their hands.  :-)

The first point is: when you're *discussing* posts, do it on the -discussion
list (as I requested).

The second point is: when you ask for off-list replies, and say you'll 
summarize, do.

The third point I will take up with you off-list, if you really insist.

I, for one, appreciate and support Jay for the information he provided.

I appreciated his follow-up to the original report, and it's certainly 
more information and less noise than you and I are contributing.  Go ahead 
and turn off your iPhone and move the constructive discussion to -discuss.

Kudos to Jay for thoughtfully following-up with the outages@ community.

Thanks,

The first point is: when you're *discussing* posts, do it on the 
-discussion list (as I requested).

This looks like he was sending a follow-up regarding something he
received help on. There may actually be people interested in known what
happened especially if they helped him. If you don't like it then don't
read it, or delete it or unsubscribe. Either way stfu. Sending several
replies about how you don't like the message is actually more annoying
then the initial email. We could really care less about what *you* are
interested in.

Message-ID: <4E80861C.1020707@netsville.com>

Anyone else seeing an outage at 1and1?  I lost contact with a server 
around 9:22am EDT.  I believe it's physically located in Dallas.  I'm 
unable to get very far into 1and1 land with a traceroute.  Their serial 
console server is also very slow to respond.

Yes, noticing the same thing for a dedicated server located in Los
Angeles.  Console server is extremely slow to respond as well.  Looks to
be routing related.

It appears to be a global event, spanning multiple data centers.  I'm
not sure if it's network-related---hosts on 1&1's corporate network are
still reachable.

Hi,

indeed, German Datacenters also affected, already verified by 1&1 
officials.
According to the techs they are working on it, although they dont have 
any clue yet...

According to their twitter feed they have 85% of their root servers back up with the rest in progress.    Also from the feed: "Due to a database-outage, in combination with a software error, we suffered from a faulty root server configuration... (cont.)"

Jason,

Do you have any details on what you were seeing?

Based on you description, I would assume you are using the Barracuda
Email Security Service and not an appliance at your site/DC?

BankOfAmerica.com is redirecting requests to an Akamai hosted site "notice.bankofamerica.com" and Chase.com's http site redirects to https://www.chase.com and appears to be down.

Could this be an attack?

I use it on my Android phone (Droid Pro, Verizon Wireless) and it functions
has my voicemail.  The application acts just fine if not faster than recent
months.  Today I got at least 2 voicemails that popped up within seconds and
even transcribed within minutes.

I do not use its SMS capabilities at all.
