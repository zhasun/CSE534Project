Intermittent Connectivity to Amazon S3 via Cogent at Qwest interconnect
###############################################################
  It appears the there is a connectivity issue between Cogent and Qwest
 causing intermittent connectivity to Amazon S3's East Coast endpoint
 (appears to be dying in Arlington, VA). Can anyone else on Cogent confirm?

SF Bay: Comcast/TATA issue or GBLX/nLayer issue?
###############################################################
 Not sure when this started, could have been going on for hours.  I just
 got in to work and attempted to RDP into my home machine -- no go.
 The asymmetric nature of routing makes this a little difficult to
 determine where the actual loss is, but I imagine what's shown in WinMTR
 is correct -- ingress packets are (were, keep reading) getting lost at
 some point.  Note in the ingress mtr the Worst field.  Also note that on
 the ingress side, packets were going from San Jose->Atlanta->Fort
 Worth->Los Angeles.
 I can't tell if this was a Comcast<->TATA Communications problem, or if
 it was a GBLX<->nLayer issue.  I'm inclined to believe the latter.
 And as usual these days, the instant I begin writing about the problem,
 it stops.  Whatever this was, however, was pretty major.  I wish I had a
 start time.  End time was approximately 15:28 PDT.  I have not checked
 BGPlay to look for routing/reconvergence.

IPv6 version of www.he.net down this morning for us

 Did anyone else see that the IPv6 access to www.he.net was down from 2:35 am
 to 3:33 am?  I still don't have an "auto-tcptraceroute6-on-www-failure" so I
 don't have more details than that the web page was offline -- host was fine.

Time Warner Cable outage
###############################################################
 I know customers on Time Warner Cable's fiber and cable (coax) service
 had problems from about 9:05 to 9:20 EST this morning.  Had anyone
 else seen issues?
 I wonder if other ISP's were effected, such as CenturyLink (a customer
 that contracted me has this as a backup, another primarily).

 There is a thread on NANOG discussing[1].  As someone else already

 Witnessed an outage at 8 CST from upstream.
 Sounded like someone was broadcasting a BGP route with an invalid attribute and caused BGP session restarts or Core Dumps/crashes on any Juniper router running version 10.4

 I know customers on Time Warner Cable's fiber and cable (coax) service
 had problems from about 9:05 to 9:20 EST this morning.  Had anyone
 else seen issues?
 I wonder if other ISP's were effected, such as CenturyLink (a customer
 that contracted me has this as a backup, another primarily).

 We had an interesting issue with AS209. When the Level(3) problem
 occurred, our BGP session with them started hold time expiring every 2
 - 10 minutes, and horrendous packet loss to our advertised prefix.
 Finally got a human around 1830 UTC with access to their router, he
 claimed he did nothing yet it conveniently fixed itself after we
 received cease from their end. Now they're blaming local loop even
 though we saw 0% loss when sourcing pings from the interface IP
 assigned by them.

 Hello --
 Our Irvine DC level3 circuit just took a hit, apparently level3 suffered
 a regional backbone routing issue losing multiple adjacency off its
 is-is domain.
 Did anyone noticed any issues off their level3 peer(s) routes?

 Our BGP session in 1 wilshire with Level3 went down.

 The weather's quite bad on the backbone today; the most prominent rumor 
 has to do with Junos 10.mumble dumping core all over the place; see NANOG
 for much more than we've had this morning.

 I think Level 3 just had a major burp in the NY area.
 Both ASN 20208 and ASN 11579 were dead in the water from about 9:12am - 
 9:19am EST.
 These are the paths in question:
 20208 12271 7843 3356

 We saw this earlier, specifically with trying to resolve
 us.srp.blackberry.com against RIMs name servers in the same segment.
 We were told that Level 3 was having issues, and that they were
 resolved before 12:00 PM ET.

 Likely, it's the Great Juniper Outage of 2011, which has been being
 covered mostly on NANOG all morning, cause Outages had indigestion. 
 Routers dumping core, root cause not yet specified; known to have affected
 Level3, and TWTelecom, among other backbone carriers.

 We received the following from our email gateway vendor:
 	LeveL 3, a Major Transit ISP, and other ISPs, are reporting 
 	connectivity issues today.  This may cause unusual challenges 
 	until it is cleared up by these ISPs.  It is more likely to 
 	impact your web traffic, but be aware that your mail might

More notes

 We received one report from an ISP customer that they couldn't VPN to a site
 with a Frontier Communications IP, and two reports from Knology customers
 about connectivity issues to the Internet.  Makes you wonder if there is a
 broader issue going on.
 Sorry that we don't have any more details -- these are small-biz customers
 who are with us or have been with us and don't have the folk to generate a
 traceroute.

 There have been some reports from various now-scrambling ISPs and NSPs
 about their Juniper JunOS devices rebooting.
 Apparently, it may be related to the (either accidental or
 intentional) exploitation of this bug: http://pastebin.com/HBWiH92j
 >From the reports of those networks having problems, it's interesting
 to hear who's running Juniper and MXes.
 <tangential sidenote>
 It's too bad that Junipers bugs aren't listed publicly. For clueful
 network operations, having this information available to them could
 have enabled them to properly weigh the risk of evaluating and
 certifying versions of their operating systems.

 There have been times in interacting with their sales engineering
 group and JTAC, who have sent me bug details that were not locatable
 when searching their PSN database.
 I have a feeling that PSNs are only noted and released to customers
 once there's a fix for a problem.
 This is getting off-topic somewhat, so I suggest we leave this thread
 be to keep the signal-to-noise ratio high.
 There's more in-depth discussion taking place on NANOG.

 Some of you may have noticed that the list was slow today.  This has been corrected, but was a result of some broken mailman configuration.  I recently updated the software and my speed patches were not properly applied.  This has been corrected.
 Sorry about this.  It impacted all lists hosted here.
 We are also upgrading the hardware in the next month or so, hopefully that also helps with the troubles.  It will certainly help me as I can finally get upgraded to an OS that supports most modern hardware.

 Our outbound phone calls go to their system, and appear connected from
 our side, but Bandwidth.com side wont ring for about 2-5 minutes.
 Seemingly getting connected at Bandwidth.com but not making a
 successful dial tone to any POTS providers.
 Multiple sites seem to be having this problem.
 The Bandwidth.com call center is offline as well, getting either a
 disconnected message, or the number simply will not ring (from
 cellphones and landlines)
 Not noticing any issues here in Denver sending calls to the Denver and Atlanta servers in a round robin. No customer complaints either - yet....

 Our inbound from core2 appears to be fine, outbound seems to be good to

 I saw issues earlier this week when I was doing traceroutes to their NYC
 wholesale and DFW wholesale switches. I was going via XO and seeing lots of
 packetloss. I moved the outbound traffic to a provider that got to them via
 Cogent and things cleared up instantly.

 Greetings,
 Did anyone notice a 2-5 min minor hit on Level 3 or other carriers around 10:15-10:25? We saw two spikes in bgp updates coming from Level 3 and lost monitoring momentarily. Doesn't seem to have impacted much, but I was curious if anyone saw anything.
 Thanks,
 Preston

TWC Wisconsin outage
###############################################################
 As of 3:15 CST We are seeing ~15% packet loss on 2 TWC MetroE circuits 
 in Wisconsin and lost our BGP transit session in Milwaukee.
 I'm still on hold but the TWC guy said he was hearing a lot of calls 
 coming in from Wisconsin starting around that time.

 a mtr or some sort, diag or examples.    East coast?  Central? Mountain?
 West-Side? Level3? TWTC? Quest? ATT? XO?
 I think Frank can pipe up with more questions and what not...

 I don't have any details.  Still trying to figure out what the problem is.
 We aren't getting complaints of not being able to connect to our network by
 our customers, but we are seeing a lot of problems between us and our
 upstream ITSP vendors.  Our ITSP vendors also seem to be having a lot of
 problems with call setups.

 I've been seeing heavy loss from the US to London for the past few hours 
 (IAD and Orlando sources and destinations).  tinet.net and telia are where 
 we're seeing it drop, but ymmv of course.

 tempted to ask, in effect, "is anyone else seeing any problems
 anywhere on any carriers?" to provide enough detail to localize the
 problem to specific carrier(s) and specific locations (endpoints or
 apparent trouble spots from traces), or just keep quiet respecting the
 need for signal amongst the noise.
 I'm willing to hear I'm asking too much, from the list owner, or
 others sufficiently clued to have provided useful details when they
 post here about new issues.  Not so much from coworkers of people
 reporting problems here lacking key details and soliciting responses
 likely to be similarly devoid of useful details, as they're the ones
 dragging down the signal:noise ratio here, which is already low and
 seems to be getting worse.

 Yup; Intellectual Property was a *really* bad idea, and patents, copyrights and
 trademarks should all be abolished immediately.
 But that's not important now.
 If you tell us what kind of problem you're seeing, down whose link to where, we
 might have some more information for you...

 First, be careful about forwarding internal mail out to mailing lists; you
 can leak things that way which people might prefer you didn't.
 Second, if XO is involved, you should see this week's NANOG archive, wherein
 we discuss the fact that XO has been known to put in blocks down to the 
 IP/port level without notice; it's possible that might have some bearing on 
 your problems.  This was specifically mentioned in the context of SIP.

META: How To Ask Questions On Mailing Lists
###############################################################
 I'd like to remind everyone of -- and encourage you to read, if you haven't 
 lately -- my two favorite essays on how to get help from the Internet:
 The first is "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Raymond and Rick
 Moen:
   http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
 and the second is PuTTY author Simon Tatham's "How To Report Bugs Effectively":
   http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html
 The short version is: people on the Internet help you for free.  Remember that,
 and do your homework first, so that they don't make fun of you for sport 
 instead.  :-)

 After a couple more bits o'tuning today, propagation delay through the

 Thanks to Jared Mauch, who hosts these lists for us (along with quite a number

 Jared has a hardware upgrade schedules for puck sometime in the next month or
 so, which should improve things further for all the services he hosts.

 I am working on upgrading the hardware of the host that hosts this list.  I believe I have a comprehensive list of tasks that run on this host that I will be using to migrate the services, but wanted to warn people that the host will be undergoing work in the coming week.
 This is not only a hardware but an OS change as well, so a fairly large project to undertake.
 If you have questions, please direct them off-list.  This should be a nice upgrade in performance across the board.

 I have most of this covered its just migrating the OS, applications, databases (yes, plural) and making sure there is a good inventory of all the parts such as perl and php modules built properly, oh and moving the ipv4 and ipv6 addresses. 
 So far I've abandoned a larger idea of replacing sendmail at this point. That combined with other things are making it difficult to set aside a few hours to supervise each component of the switch as everything is on a single ip/DNS name. 
 I do have a written plan that will help me finalize the moving parts when it's time. It's more a matter of time. I did one related system last night and a few during the day. Just three more to go :-)
 Puck is obviously the biggest one just in terms of multi-use scope. (secondary DNS services, lists, web, BGP monitoring, and the obligatory site for my wife as well. That one must go smoothly so I can sleep at night :-)
 This move will be good as it brings the system to modern hardware and dumps an Os that has lagging hardware support. Will also reduce my OPEX as usable packages are available meaning mailman may be the only manually built package! Good news all around as compiling an Os from source and all the parts isn't a good use of time and resources in 2011/2012.

 Looks like ACLs block anything past the uoregon.edu router.  What I'm
 saying is that my traceroute looks identical to the one below, so the
 problem is either on the return path or is somewhere within then
 network "past" the uoregon.edu router.

 It just seemed like general network congestion/misrouting issues: high
 latency, dropped packets, etc...
 It appears to be resolved now from what I can tell.
