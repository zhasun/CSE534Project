Time Warner Outage in Dublin Ohio(Columbus area)

  Does anyone have any info here? We have no ETA's and they have been down
 for over 12 hours. The last person I pryed out of them it might be a fiber
 cut. Has anyone else heard anything?
 The Rep told me that over 14 nodes are offline.

CFR website refusing connections
###############################################################
 The website for the Council on Foreign Relations, www.cfr.org<http://www.cfr.org>, has been refusing connections for most of the day today.  Normally I'd chalk it up to random problems, but given the recent watering-hole attack against the site, I thought I'd mention it here and see if anyone had heard anything.

 I've had several "looks OK" reports, so it's probably a problem local to me.  I am seeing RST packets apparently from 75.101.137.229, but sometimes someone sets our firewalls to send those instead of silently dropping the traffic, so that could be it.
 Thanks, all.

 The "good" news is it they must have a backup/protect ring as I have been
 able to ping our device but with 300+ms ping times and 50% or more packet
 loss but bad enough its more or less down.
 Latest update:
 Information Update:   This is Windstream emailing the latest status of this

 shortly.  There is still no ETA at this time.  We will provide further

Hostway Tampa
###############################################################
 Something seems to be up at Hostway's facility in Tampa.  We have
 servers there that suddenly went dark, tech support's Tampa phone
 number is giving a fast busy signal.  I reached someone in Hostway
 sales that said they're aware of an issue in Tampa but their office
 hadn't been able to reach anyone in the Tampa NOC due to a phone
 problem, so no details or ETA.
 Starting to see responses back from servers now though ping times are
 sometimes normal and occasionally higher than usual, but traffic seems
 to be flowing again.

Twitter issues

 (Hopefully the third try's the charm)
 Anybody else seeing connectivity issues reaching Twitter? (AS 13414). I'm seeing a what looks like a Layer 3 portchannel with a misbehaving or downed member link past ae60.pao1-cr1.twttr.com (199.16.159.85). Customer reports started rolling in about 11:30 AM EST yesterday for the main website and t.co.
 http://downrightnow.com/twitter also shows problems. I've been trying to get ahold of someone at Twitter's NOC but haven't had any luck so far.

Twitter connectivity issues?
###############################################################
 Hi list,
 I'm seeing what appears to be a broken Layer 3 or 4 port channel (load balancing) somewhere in Twitter land. I have no idea if this is affecting anyone other than us as searching hasn't yielded anything, and Twitter's status page shows no issues.
 At the end of my message I've put some example of what I'm seeing. Behaviour changes based on source/dest IP, based on many customer and infrastructure addresses in different subnets, and a variety of the A records returned for twitter.com. We are multihomed so that might obscure the problem, I've included a sample out our 2nd provider.
 The problem appears to be somewhere past ae60.pao1-cr1.twttr.com (199.16.159.85)
 If anyone from Twitter is out there please drop me a line... we are AS 23252
 If anyone else is experiencing this I'd love to know also
 Thanks

 Hi list,
 Sorry for all that spam - headers show puck.nether.net sat on my messages :(
 I got ahold of someone at Twitter and we narrowed it down to an issue related to my upstream provider after all.
 Cheers

 Hi list,
 I'm seeing what appears to be a broken Layer 3 or 4 port channel (load balancing) somewhere in Twitter land. I have no idea if this is affecting anyone other than us as searching hasn't yielded anything, and Twitter's status page shows no issues.
 At the end of my message I've put some example of what I'm seeing. Behaviour changes based on source/dest IP, based on many customer and infrastructure addresses in different subnets, and a variety of the A records returned for twitter.com. We are multihomed so that might obscure the problem, I've included a sample out our 2nd provider.
 The problem appears to be somewhere past ae60.pao1-cr1.twttr.com (199.16.159.85)
 If anyone from Twitter is out there please drop me a line... we are AS 23252
 If anyone else is experiencing this I'd love to know also
 Thanks

 Hi list,
 I tried to send this yesterday, but after 15 hours I don't see my post, so appologies for any duplicates. 
 Customer complaints started rolling in around 11:30 AM EST (GMT-0:500) yesterday, or approx 23 hours ago. I'm seeing what appears to be a broken Layer 3 or 4 port channel (load balancing) somewhere in Twitter land. I have no idea if this is affecting anyone other than us as searching hasn't yielded anything, and Twitter's status page shows no issues. 
 At the end of my message I've put some example of what I'm seeing. Behaviour changes based on source/dest IP, based on many customer and infrastructure addresses in different subnets, and a variety of the A records returned for twitter.com. We are multihomed so that might obscure the problem, I've included a sample out our 2nd provider. 
 The problem appears to be somewhere past ae60.pao1-cr1.twttr.com (199.16.159.85)
 If anyone from Twitter is out there please drop me a line... I've dropped a line to the ARIN NOC contact but haven't gotten a response. We are AS 23252
 If anyone else is experiencing this I'd love to know also
 Thanks

Power Outage/Fiber Splice In Hawaii?
###############################################################
 Looks like there is either a rather Large Power outage or Fiber Cut In Hawaii at the moment. I personally have multiple circuits down and Random packet loss to Different Carriers on the Islands. Anyone else seeing anything similar?

 <joking>Internet 2 and APAN are having a joint meeting in Honolulu. Naturally, it wouldn't be a big meeting of techs without a fiber cut to go with it.

 Sorry, we had our fiber cut on Monday. They keep ignoring my emails to avoid cuts during our conferences. ;-)

 I can confirm that the ILEC here (Hawaiian Telcom) is/was having 
 troubles that're even affecting their POTS.  I no longer have any
 insight as to what the trouble is exactly, though, as I haven't 
 worked there for a couple of years.

 So how's Australia connectivity to Singapore atm?   One of the ISP's in New Zealand is randomly routing via the US... Telstraclear is generally routing via

 It's India, Pakistan, China etc that aren't so good.
 Europe to China is terrible though.  I've got a friend who was asking about remote between UK/China.  And if it's possible to get good routes to there.
 And I can't find anyone doing good routing to China from Europe.  I'm sure there's meant to be a cable with a good path?

 It was acting strange from NL/UK too.. but more like 250 to tokyo.
 Curious.  Russia may be even worse.  I must admit I don't know a lot about Europe
 routing.  What I did find earlier was that India from UK wasn't too bad, using the
 looking glass server of vr.org which has lots of locations. 
 Hmm, I'll try it on that vr.org looking glass ffrom India.

 so doing the go up at the end thing.  Curiously my mtr I'd left running to Japan
 went a bit lower.  i wonder if that is congestion due to the cable break.
 if I trace to www.iij.ad.jp it's a bit better

 then you still need good connectivity to that host in india though.. best i can do is
 trace back to the gateway you were using.

 And yeah it's way too high, and oesn't seem to even get to there.
 There may be better routes through Pakistan, as I seem to remember that they use
 both Asia routes and Europe routes.
 Best I can seem to find is Japan <-> India of 125 to 132 msec, India <-> Uk of 161 msec.
 And the route from UK to Japan was like 278 to 285 going via new york/los angeles.
 That said the Japan traffic to India was going via Singapore, there may be a more direct
 path.  And I don't know if 161 is good for India <-> UK.
 There's meant to be some new cable between Japan and Europe through Russia, which may help
 things.

 Between Mumbai (India) and Marseille (France), you have SMW4, TGN-EA,

 Note: Marseille is at about 21ms of London via Paris.
 So far, from UK/France, with cables I've seen in use, you go East via
 India to reach: Singapore, Hong-Kong.
 But then, to reach Japan, you go West, via North America.

 Do you have a traceroute of any of these good routes?  Are they under

 I've never seen a traceroute between Japan (UTC+9) and either London
 (0/+1), Germany (+1/+2) or Moscow (+4 (formerly +3/+4)) that didn't go
 through usually both NYC (-5/-4) and SJC (-8/-7).
 All in the northern hemisphere, timezone-wise Moscow and Japan are
 only 5 hours apart, whereas Moscow and SJC are 12 hours apart right
 now, and SJC and Japan are an extra 7 hours.  5 vs. 19? :-)
 Actually, there were a couple of weeks when routing between HE.net in
 FMT and a RETN.net-based connection in MSK was going through Japan one
 way, and it was adding a little extra latency.  As an end-user, that
 was the first and only time ever that I had any remote proof of any
 internet pipes leaving Russia not through Europe!

 The latency could have been around 130ms if it didn't go through NA.
 Wishful thinking, I know!

 China telecom among other appears at de-cix. it's my experience that 
 paths into china on the transit side are deliberately operated at 
 capacity. When I worked for a large electronics manufacturing concern we 
 had TDM and/or later l3vpn paths into our network in china from europe, 
 one through central asia and another via the middle east, both required 
 multiple provider handoffs.

 Sadly, no "real" networks use these routes, and Rostelecom is not
 particularly known for having any settlement-free peering in Russia
 whatsoever (in the old days, they had all Moscow "interconnects" go
 through London).  I know of no non-premium hosting providers in Moscow
 that buy transit from Rostelecom.  And no other major telecoms in
 Russia seem to have any Moscow-Japan routes that don't go through NA.
 Cheers,
 Constantine.

 A lot of the Asia traffic from AU can still go via U.S. because its much
 cheaper.
 The stupidest thing Australians do is rely primarily on Sydney for 90%
 of int traffic, the cables and Sats out of Perth wont hold up if
 terrorists blew the crap out of Sydney points.  Brisbane is the next
 best landing point (and technically closer than Syd), but is ignored,
 Melbourne pretty much too, though IIRC there is (or was) a cable from
 Melbourne to NZ

 Message: 
 Hello,
 First off, thanks for an amazing utility.  This is in no way a gripe or complaint because what you are doing is awesome.  I did want to let you know that we were considering displaying both the outages.org map and list views of open alerts on our NOC dashboard (TV), but really weren't able to because we wanted to be able to save things like filters for types of outages and date ranges after refresh.  It appears that anytime the page is refreshed the view goes back to a 6 month unfiltered view.  I'm sure you can imagine all sorts of awesomeness (Landscape vs portrait orientation etc etc etc) that would be nice, so my only suggestion is to consider unmanned-dashboard type of viewing functionality.  (I feel funny even making a suggestion for something that I don't pay for and already is so awesome, so please take it for what it's worth)
 Thanks,
 Chris

 There was a hardware issue with one of our telephony bridges in San Jose, which has now been resolved.

 Many thanks to Avleen Vig from etsy.com who suggested that I run tune2fs 
 to release the reserved blocks to free up disk space which it did about 
 5% enough for the system to jump start mysql and viola, wiki came up.
 Now off to doing security updates, hopefully this does not fill up the 
 space again.

Charter Peering issues??(At least ICMP)
###############################################################
 Anyone else having any issues reaching IP's on Charter communications? We
 have 3 sites down from our monitoring tool(peered via Level 3) and trace
 routes from level3's looking glass fail. Their looking glass also shows no
 routers to the /4 that our IP is part of. I've noticed issues from
 Centurylink's Looking glass as well on certain POP's and from Cogent as
 well.
 Traceroutes: I had to remove our office IP's for privacy but I think it
 gets the point across that we can't reach both ways. Oddly enough SSH seems
 to work sometimes so I wonder if its mostly an ICMP issue with occasional
 drops of other traffic.
 Office is in Ohio, IP/other route is in Tennessee but we also have it down
 in South and North Carolina.

 Lots of packetloss to their servers and most, if not all calls fail. Just 
 got off the phone with them - they are aware and working on the problem they 
 say. They have not created a master ticket created as of yet.

Bay Area packet loss at Comcast (gblx.net, he.net)
###############################################################
 I think this happens practically every evening recently, for traffic
 between Comcast in NorCal and Linode at he.net in Fremont, around
 gblx.net.
 Today I have been monitoring through a crontab script since 16:00 PT,
 with a 10-minute mtr runs in a loop.  The traffic loss has started in
 the 20:50/21:00 timeframe, and is still ongoing (22:20).  There
 weren't a 10-minute interval between 20:50 and 22:20 without at least
 a 4% packet loss (often more than that).

 Anyone else has noticed?  ssh is completely unusable for a couple of
 seconds every now and again.
 It seems to have subdued back to a 0% loss as of 22:20/22:30 window,
 but I bet it'll be back.

 Thats not an outage, thats a congested link - probably you should report to
 HE / GBLX / Comcast....

 I get packetloss on te-1-12-0-0-ar01.sfsutro.ca.sfba.comcast.net to my
 linode @ fmt at weekends and at nights, looks more like just too much
 load rather than an outage

 I'm not on the Comcast backbone team, but for what it's worth I just ran
 MTR to 96.120.14.165 and to router1-fmt.linode.com for quite a while and
 never lost a single packet from my desktop inside Comcast. I don't think
 I'm hitting the problematic node, though. If I'm reading the results above
 correctly, in all cases the problem begins when traffic hits
 po4-20G.ar2.SJC2.gblx.net.
 Am I misreading that?
 Regards,
 John

 1. Usually Level 3-owned routers use ICMP prioritisation; routing
 (forwarding) has priority over this.
 2. Many traceroute implementations use UDP for their probe packets (in
 attempt to solicit ICMP TTL exceeded messages to learn the network
 topology); please make sure you're using pure ICMP all the way through
 if possible.
 3. Your below traces indicate a destination IP of 64.208.27.65, which is
 not sufficient (ICMP prioritisation will be used to explain what you're
 seeing, even if there is a real issue).  Please pick a destination IP of
 an actual host that's somewhere behind that router which will respond to
 ICMP packets reliably.
 You need to see if the packet loss "trickles downward" past that hop to
 every subsequent hop after that point (including the destination host),
 or if high latency, if the latency "trickles downward" as well.
 Here's an example of a bogus claim as a result of ICMP prio:

 All I got from Level3 was that the problem went away before it could be 
 isolated.

 Looks like the one way audio issue was resolved but we are still only
 getting 1 in 5 calls can actually get through at least in the LA area.

 Have a customer that does a lot of email to Korea and saw their mail backing
 up this morning due to 'host not found' errors to a domain they email
 frequently. Figured they let their domain expire, but in checking it out, I
 find I cannot query the name servers for their domain, which are
 ns[1234].whoisdomain.kr. Traffic to them dies on Level3 in LA:

 How is this a "global outage"?  From my perspective you should be asking
 your Thai ISP why they don't have peering with other providers for
 redundancy (or if they do, why they haven't properly configured route
 failover, or even manually reconfigured to use an alternate peer).

 I know we're experiencing major Charter issues in Northern Wisconsin.  I
 don't have any specific ticket numbers to reference, but we're seeing
 clients in northern and central Wisconsin have rolling outages.

 Please see my below post on this matter, which I posted only 2 days ago:
 https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2013-January/005111.html
 What you've shown in your mtr does not show any issue of any kind with
 Level 3.  The packet loss shown at hops 4/5/6 does not "trickle down"
 each subsequent hop (look at hop 7 onward for proof), nor is there any
 sign of latency increase either.
 On the other hand, the 2nd mtr you provided shows some degree of packet
 loss starting at hop 2 (TW Telecom) which *does* "trickle down" through
 all subsequent hops (egress).  If you want to know how many packets were
 lost, look at the --order flag to mtr (I recommend --order=LSRNABW).
 Plain and simple: talk to TW Telecom about the loss in their network.

 Thanks, I am aware of what the traceroute shows and how a traceroute works.
 The intent of the traceroute was primarily to show where I see our paths
 between Level 3 and TW Telecom converge.
 Plain and simple - we are experiencing connectivity issues over our Level 3
 connection, which we're not seeing over our TW Telecom connection for
 traffic destined to the same location.

 Chris, is there some reason you're not providing actual
 source/destination IPs for each of your mtrs?
 The reason I'm asking is because I was left to believe what you were
 providing was both ends of an asymmetric connection (i.e. mtr #1 was
 for x.x.x.x to y.y.y.y, mtr #2 was for y.y.y.y to x.x.x.x).
 However, your 2nd paragraph below ("we're seeing issues over one
 connections but not another") seems to indicate what you provided are
 two mtrs across completely different circuits.
 So which is it?

 Ah, my apologies on the confusion. They're two distinct paths out, not
 traceroutes from each end.
 I chose not to include the destination IP because the issues we're seeing a
 more wide spread than to a single IP.
 Level 3 managed to get back to us - they were originally reporting back to
 us that they are experiencing connectivity issues for some of their clients
 in Austin, which they're now denying and still continuing to investigate.

 It looks like the situation has resolved itself in the last minute - I'm
 still waiting for an update from Level 3, but from 2 off-list replies it
 looks like there were a few people who've experienced routing issues with
 Level 3 in Houston today.

 Gotcha, now we're on the same page!  :-)
 So can you provide return-path mtr or traceroutes that are associated
 with both of your below links?  Level 3 will probably want this as well,
 as most routing today is asymmetrical.
 Rephrased verbosely: we need to see a total of 4 mtrs/traceroutes:
 1) From x.x.x.x to y.y.y.y (your Level 3 link) -- you provided this
 2) From y.y.y.y to x.x.x.x -- need this
 3) From a.a.a.a to b.b.b.b (your TW Telecom link) -- you provided this
 4) From b.b.b.b to a.a.a.a -- need this
 What you showed in Item #1 (your L3 link) shows no actual/real issue.
 What you showed in Item #3 (your TW Telecom link) **does** show packet
 loss, but I cannot tell (without Item #4) if it's on the return-path or
 the forward-path.  I understand "your TW Telecom link is working fine"
 but the 0.1-0.2% packet loss indicates it may not be as good as you
 think.  That may be a separate issue however, or may be by design
 (QoS-like rules applied on router, etc.).
 Make sense?  :-)

Omaha subterranean explosion and fire causing circuit issues
###############################################################
 http://www.omaha.com/article/20130127/NEWS/130129676
 I've seen several hi-cap circuits belonging to one customer in the Omaha
 area bounce in and out since the explosion was first heard at 5:45 pm
 Central.  A network partner, with a much larger circuit inventory, told a
 colleague of mine that they were seeing some circuits in the Omaha area also
 doing the same.  
 At this time I am assuming that some of the transport gear is losing power
 from time to time, or when the circuit is protection switching it's not
 working like it's supposed to.
 I'm not aware if anyone in the Farnam Building, which appears to be outside
 the area affected by power problems, has had issues.

 Yep, thats weird. Can confirm facebook.com is down, but www.facebook.com is
 up. Possibly a problem with their LB since the root would have to be
 staticly set to an ip.
 facebook.com resolves to 173.252.100.16 for me in australia.

 To me that looks like the forward path is:

  4. Comcast: San Francisco, CA (always been an assumption on my part)
  5. Comcast: San Jose
  6. Comcast: Los Angeles
  7. Comcast: Los Angeles (One Wilshire)
  8. Comcast: possible FB<->Comcast peering point
  9. Facebook: Los Angeles
 10. Facebook: Atlanta (note 60ms+ latency jump for cross-country)
 11. Facebook: ???
 11. Facebook: ???
 If it went from LAX->ATL->SFO, I would expect to see the latency jump
 ~60-80ms at #9/#10, and then again at #10/#11.  But again, this is the
 forward-path only.  And I refuse to believe FRC means Franca Airport in
 Brazil.  ;-)

 My previously posted IPv4 and IPv6 traceroutes show a 4 msec incremental hop
 between atl1 and frc1, too.  If the host names are I accurate, I admit, too,
 that I don't understand how one can get between Atlanta and San Francisco in
 ~4 msec.
 My daily IPv6 tcptraceroute6 snapshot shows that I normally get to
 2a03:2880:2110:3f01:face:b00c:: via that ATL hop, but Chicago to Atlanta
 taking almost 30 msec?  More likely some asymmetric routing going on here.

 To me that looks like the forward path is:
  1. LAN
  2. Comcast: Mountain View, CA
  3. Comcast: Santa Clara, CA
  4. Comcast: San Francisco, CA (always been an assumption on my part)
  5. Comcast: San Jose
  6. Comcast: Los Angeles
  7. Comcast: Los Angeles (One Wilshire)
  8. Comcast: possible FB<->Comcast peering point
  9. Facebook: Los Angeles
 10. Facebook: Atlanta (note 60ms+ latency jump for cross-country)
 11. Facebook: ???
 11. Facebook: ???
 If it went from LAX->ATL->SFO, I would expect to see the latency jump
 ~60-80ms at #9/#10, and then again at #10/#11.  But again, this is the
 forward-path only.  And I refuse to believe FRC means Franca Airport in
 Brazil.  ;-)

 I saw the same thing here after flushing one DNS server's facebook.com
 entry.   I've now flushed that entry on all our caching DNS resolvers so
 that our end users will get the new info (caveat: local and application DNS
 caching).
 Anyone have a historical list of facebook.com's A records to see if it's
 always been just 173.252.100.16?

 I saw the same thing here after flushing one DNS server's facebook.com entry.   I've now flushed that entry on all our caching DNS resolvers so that our end users will get the new info (caveat: local and application DNS caching).
 Anyone have a historical list of facebook.com's A records to see if it's always been just 173.252.100.16?

DIDWW Outage in Tijuana, Mexico
###############################################################
 This was received by one of my techs from DIDWW.
 Currently DIDWW has been undergoing a service disruption on
 all Mexico, Tijuana numbers. The cause of the present situation
 was an unexpected act of vandalism. Therefore, it has been
 taking a while for the services to be fully restored.
 For the moment, we have been informed that the damaged
 equipment is being replaced and the interconnection will be
 restored in the course of the two upcoming days.

Issues with XO
###############################################################
 I don't have a lot of info at this time, but I wonder if anyone else
 is seeing issues with XO. Both IP and SIP services seem to be
 struggling.
 I'll update with info as soon as I can get to my VPN or I hear back
 from them (they've confirmed issues but don't have details yet).
 Best,
 Gabe

 XO:

 "Cisco Node" fail this morning. When it was brought back up, the

 We're working out of XO's SLC office. That's all I've got for you :/

Windstream Issue in Michigan (Flint)
###############################################################
 I have been having lots of issues with unstable T1 circuits in the Flint Michigan area all week. I'm normally use to just getting right in when I call but this week only get "Please hold for the next available technician" for about 25 mins so far.
 Brian
 brian at 5thelement.com noted this on the listserv on Tuesday: "I've had 2
 different T1 circuits down in the Flint area yesterday and today"

 Several customers have reported broken connections, random problems, and
 overall outages overnight.  I myself experienced this with my home

 Going straight to www.amazon.com fails for me from Nebraska. 
   However, if you're able to bypass the home page, it seems 
 to be working.  I was able to hit 
 www.amazon.com/ref=gno_logo and some previous links.

 Worked for me when www.amazon.com resolved to 205.251.242.54 and
 72.21.194.212.  With companies that have such a large Internet presence
 that's it's not enough to say anymore the "site" is down on port 80
 (geographically hosted and potentially anycasted) or 53 (potentially
 anycasted), one really needs the IP address that was resolved and a
 traceroute to it so one can see the path.

 though.

 Interesting -
    - http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/amazon.com shows Amazon as being
    down, but I can get to www.amazon.com and drill around in the site just
    fine.

 getting to Amazon, did have some brief problems earlier in the day when 
 others reported problems.

Mediacom DNS server issue?
###############################################################
 I was first alerted by our email server because there was no DNS resolution
 for mchsi.com.
 Every indication from my testing is that Mediacom's two DNS servers:
 	NS1.MCOMDC.COM 74.84.103.134 
 	NS2.MCOMDC.COM 74.84.119.134
 are down.
 I can't query anything about mchsi.com or mediacomcable.com, but
 www.mediacomcc.com, which uses different nameservers, resolved just fine.

 Additionally, NS1 is responding to ICMP pings while NS2 isn't.

 For me, neither ns[12].mcomdc.com responds to ICMP or DNS queries.
 I'm now seeing email for mediacombb.net backing up, too, as they use the
 same DNS servers.
 According to robtex (http://host.robtex.com/ns2.mcomdc.com.html#shared),
 some other domains affected are gronkulator.com and inland.net.

 Our backed up emails are clearing and both of Mediacom's DNS servers resolve
 and all their websites load.  I'm going to assume that they've resolved the
 issue.
