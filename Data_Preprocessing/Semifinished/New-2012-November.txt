 Also from Peer1 tech forum they are physically carrying diesel jerry cans
 from ground floor to the day tanks to keep the gennies going.
 Thats 17 floors up steps - if anyone needs a workout and their gym is shut
 pop down to them !

 JFYI -
 Just heard that 111 8th Avenue facility in New York has run into some
 technical difficulties with the fuel pumping system to a subset of
 generators within the building, affecting the AC power. Not sure how
 many floors this is affecting.
 regards,
 /virendra
 Zayo (Abovenet) reported that they lost cooling capacity on the 7th floor and will be shutting down non essential equipment. Temps are at 93 degrees. 
 They said they may also start downing redundant services if things get worse.

 Bill,
 The 3-letter abbreviations used by Abovenet correlate with airport
 codes.  LaGuardia Airport = LGA = New York.

 I'm aware it's an airport code, but those tend to be used in the general
 region of an airport so it's not always super specific as to an exact
 location. The "5" also implies they have multiple facilities in that
 same general area.

 Expect to see some reduction in capacity (and possible packet loss) through there, they've discussed shutting down redundant elements to reduce heat load. They have a 2MW generator trucking in from Jersey they plan to hook up to get cooling back up and running but it's another 3-4 hours out. Temperatures are above 100 in the space according to [1]

Windstream fiber cut(s) between Wilmington and Philly?
###############################################################
 Thanks for the replies both on and off list everyone. I did eventually get an
 update last night as well as a follow up this morning. A cut between Warminster
 and West Chester PA has us down. Sounds like it could be a couple days before
 the power company lets them in to splice. Thankfully we're redundant.

 This is not about a specific outage.
 I'm trying to find out if anyone knows to issues impacting Level 3 in the
 NY metro area.
 Currently I'm only aware of issues with AboveNet (Zayo) and Cogent.

 My wife has a site on Monmouth Telecom which is downstream of L3 in the NJ/NY area and they've been offline for a few days now due to a L3  issue.

 While there's a LOT more than that that's hosed, including a bunch of 
 our VZ circuits and Internap services, which come and go, I'm not  
 having problems specifically with L3 circuits or their SIP services.  As 
 others have reported L3 issues, that's probably just dumb luck on the 
 routing of our circuits.   We've got equipment and circuits terminated 
 at 325 Hudson.
 However, note that anything going through
 60 Hudson St
 or
 111 8th Ave
 or
 other places that I've not had to investigate personally but suspect are 
 out there
 are probably not sources of consistent happiness at this time; though 
 last I heard they'd gotten the fuel pumps in 111 8th partially happy 
 again (or at least my circuit to there is talking to something live on 
 that end at this time).  We're being told, however, that our VZ circuits 
 that go through 60 Hudson are very wet, absolutely no ETR available at 
 this time.  I suspect that their gear is not very salt water resistant :-(

 So far so good.
 Only issue noticed was an increase from usual 70ms trans-Atlantic rtd to 
 ~100ms around the 30th Oct, but now back to normal.
 Level 3 NOC is telling us that all systems are running normally on 
 generators as per the emergency preparedness plan and they continue to 
 see no risk to our New York colocation or connectivity..
 No info about runtimes or fuel deliveries, etc from them unfortunately.

 We hit Atlanta, And last week I saw both 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 show about 45% 
 loss from both our network (AS36295) and my home cable connection 
 (AS33363).
 Lasted till about friday. I figured they ratelimited ICMP because DNS 
 resolution didn't seem to suffer at all. It seems to have cleared up

 It's been well-established for many years that yes, ICMP is rate-limited
 to some degree (both on the router preceding the host as well as the
 host itself) for 4.2.2.1 and/or 4.2.2.2.  Whether or not all the
 servers/all the routers are configured identically is anyone's guess,
 and it's even more difficult to determine given use of anycast.
 Just a reminder for folks: please do not use 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2
 indefinitely.  Their intention is to be used for temporary situations,
 i.e. setting up a workstation or server where you've forgotten to write
 down the DNS servers, thus allowing you to have something that gets you
 resolution so that you can get online to look up proper DNS servers.
 I only state this because of lines like this:
 I'm under the impression that Google's 8.8.8.8 is more intended for
 "long-term" use, but pleas do not quote me on that.

 I'm using 4.2.2.2 strictly as an ICMP test on Smokeping.

 Hi,
 I am new to this list.   Currently having latency issues with our internet connection.
 We are a Windstream customer in Northeastern Ohio.   I am unable to get through to Windstream's support.
 Anyone hear of any issues that might be causing this?
 Thanks

 Are there any other resources that you're trying to reach that you
 could try tracing to?
 Traceroutes and pings to Microsoft destinations are often misleading,
 as they tend to filter ICMP messages pretty aggressively.

 For whatever reason the latency is now gone.
 Maybe it only took me google'ing an unknown mailing list, subscribing, and sending out a question ... and poof, problem fixed.

 We are seeing issues with our Windstream circuit in Chicago today. Taking major packet loss. Also seeing intermittent problems in NYC with the same type of outage.  Is anyone else experiencing anything similar?

 Yes - we are too. We just spent 55 minutes on hold with Windstream support.  We finally got through and were told the issues were related to Sunday's 7 1/2 outage and yesterday's intermittent issues.  I don't know what's happening in NY but the specific issues in Chicago are related to equipment failure on Windstream's platform in Chicago.  When we asked why the backup equipment didn't kick in, the reply was that the problem entailed a communication issue between the primary and the backup equipment.   Root cause has still not been established, hence the ongoing problems.

Verizon CO's in lower Manhattan?
###############################################################
 Hi,
 Thanks to everyone who's been providing Sandy-related updates - massively helpful to get some out-of-band information.
 I have a question - hoping someone on the list can help: our primary Internet circuit is through Cogent, via Verizon local loop. Cogent's facility at 33 Whitehall in NYC was hit hard, but evidently they're back up on generator power as of yesterday. Since we're off-net, right now we're at the mercy of Verizon to get their side of things back up and running, and we've gotten very little info on that front (which we completely understand given the massive outages Verizon and other telcos are still facing right now.) Cogent has been great with their own updates, but they're still saying there's no solid ETR on Verizon.
 Does anyone have any insight into when Verizon may restore service to their impacted CO's downtown?
 Thanks in advance
 Chad

 Just a heads up.  I was informed by Windstream today they are having issues with their network based firewall which is causing issues with latency.  Windstream thought the issue was resolved yesterday but it wasn't and are currently working on it.

Qwest/Centurylink Outage in East TX
###############################################################
 We have a T1 down in West LA, called century link and the NOC person told
 me she has had a flood of calls(sounded like she was alone) and it looks
 like a core router is down in the area. She had alerted the backbone team.
 This is east of Dallas by a ways but I'm not sure how large of an area this
 router served.

 Service restored. Here is the RFO:
 The higher level issue has been resolved at this time.
 RFO: CenturyLink maintenance on the core routers tonight was not supposed
 to be customer affecting. Once we notified backbone they quickly corrected
 the problem.
 Thanks

 Please provide a traceroute along with any claims of outages, especially of
 anycasted services.
 Also, it would help to clarify whether you're referring to Google Public
 DNS (8.8.4.4. and 8.8.8.8) or to ns[1-4].google.com.

AT&T Apparently Blocking ooVoo -- WAS: Re: ooVoo WebSite Outage?
###############################################################
 Okay, I hate to reply to my own posting, but...
 There are apparently multiple complaints about AT&T blocking ooVoo. I
 opened a case and have received responses that indicate others on AT&T
 networks are having issues where ooVoo is unreachable and it appears
 to be blocked by AT&T.
 The www.oovoo.com address still falls off the face of the Earth as
 indicated below, but the other ooVoo IPs will trace to the destination
 IP, but it appears that 80 and 443 are being filtered by AT&T.
 ("secure" was passing HTTPS traffic the other day, but hasn't for the
 past 2 days.)
 Nmap scan report for secure.oovoo.com (63.111.29.147)
 Host is up (0.056s latency).
 Not shown: 996 filtered ports
 PORT     STATE  SERVICE
 21/tcp   open   ftp
 113/tcp  closed auth
 554/tcp  open   rtsp
 7070/tcp open   realserver
 I should add that if I proxy my web connection through a server I have
 at ServerBeach, I have no issues accessing ooVoo.
 Thoughts / comments on how to get this fixed?
 TIA!

 At an AT&T provided MIS router (on premise) or a hop or two past that?
 I'm curious to know if they're pushing a blocking ACL to MIS with
 managed (AT&T provided) routers or further up from that, which would
 mean that customers with their own router wouldn't be affected.

 I do not have AT&T as an ISP.  However, my ISP does have them as one of their upstream providers.  It appears BGP is trying to route packets destined for 63.111.29.0/24 via the AT&T upstream and I can see it failing as soon as it hits AT&T's network.

 Let's move this to outages-discussion.
 Jim: I would suggest having your ISP send traffic for 63.111.29.0/24 to one
 of their other upstream providers, to route around the issue, and then open
 a ticket with AT&T.

 One possibility is that ooVoo peers with AT&T, was being DoSed, and

 Alternatively, this may have something to do with it, but it seems like
 an awfully big hammer, and applied in the wrong place....

 The phrase "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately
 explained by stupidity" might be good to remember when dealing with
 ATT.  Not saying that they never having any of the former, but
 organizationally they seem to have a lot of the latter.  (Not a slam
 at everyone at ATT, I know plenty of good people there; their
 organization structure can be frustrating to no end to deal with
 though).

 Yes they block it, can't get to it from a mpls connection or their uverse service.

 Okay, I hate to reply to my own posting, but...
 There are apparently multiple complaints about AT&T blocking ooVoo. I
 opened a case and have received responses that indicate others on AT&T
 networks are having issues where ooVoo is unreachable and it appears
 to be blocked by AT&T.
 The www.oovoo.com address still falls off the face of the Earth as
 indicated below, but the other ooVoo IPs will trace to the destination
 IP, but it appears that 80 and 443 are being filtered by AT&T.
 ("secure" was passing HTTPS traffic the other day, but hasn't for the
 past 2 days.)
 Nmap scan report for secure.oovoo.com (63.111.29.147)
 Host is up (0.056s latency).
 Not shown: 996 filtered ports
 PORT STATE SERVICE
 21/tcp open ftp
 113/tcp closed auth
 554/tcp open rtsp
 7070/tcp open realserver
 I should add that if I proxy my web connection through a server I have
 at ServerBeach, I have no issues accessing ooVoo.
 Thoughts / comments on how to get this fixed?
 TIA!

XO regional outage?
###############################################################
 We've got multiple circuits down in the metro D.C. region. XO has no ETA
 as of yet. Any one else having problems or possibly have more
 information about the nature of the outage? Not getting much out of XO.
 	<CCCBA8AA.46FE1%bgibbons@napco.com>
 Yeah. I got that recorded message too. Waiting on an XO customer
 service rep to call me back. I suspect an ETR is unlikely though.

 We heard that XO is experiencing outages that spread from Chicago to NYC and DC.
 Supposedly, they have found a hardware issue, and are attempting to route around it.

 If you're interested in the 4.2.2.2 / 4.2.2.1 resolvers, by all means
 ping and measure them based on DNS response time.

 Other destinations are fine, but I've never seen this behavior before on this link.  Excellent points though, thanks for contributing.  I've engaged cogent for a peek.  
 FWIW, they say they still have a lot of the NYC area on backup power and even had a batch of "bad fuel" delivered to at least one site.  Sandy is still causing them headaches.

Possible NTP attacks?
###############################################################
 There are what appears to be a statistically significant number of reports
 this week of possible anomalies with NTP timekeeping in various parts of the
 net.
 Given how fundamental NTP is to many things -- including many types of 
 authentication -- it would seem to be a good idea to set your "is there
 something wrong with NTP" bit, such that you're keeping an eye on the 
 issue.
 If you have monitoring on your NTP servers; watch it.
 If you have monitoring, but not on your NTP servers, perhaps that would
 be a good project for the short week.
 If you don't have any network monitoring at all, let me recommend Munin,
 Cacti, and Nagios, in that order, of packages I have experience with, and
 I hear good things about Zabbix, too.
 Remember: "I can't log in" and "I get this weird error when going to a 
 secure website" are top-drawer indications that your timebase may be off.
 Followups to -discussion, please.
 Cheers,

 It's probably worth noting that GPS isn't directly dependent on the
 functionality of tick and tock...
 Tick and tock were unreachable for about 8 hours or so back around the
 4th of July after the windstorms in that area too. It's good practice to
 sync to multiple timeservers to avoid single points of failure.

NTP issues from 11/19/2012
###############################################################
 Emailed the USNO timekeepers and this is the reply I received last night 
 at 9:44pm EDT.  I was asking about the issue and looking for a better 
 definition of the time frame of the issue.
 Hope this helps everyone narrow down their scope.
 The best outage time I have right now is from 21:07 UTC until 21:59 UTC of November 19 (MJD 56250), which of course corresponds to 16:07-16:59 Eastern Standard Time.
 Our systems manager Jeffrey Prillaman will send notifications hopefully tomorrow, but you may post this, along with our apologies.

 On behalf of Virendra and Frank, let me take this moment to thank everyone
 on the Outages family of mailing lists, and wish you all (well, the 'Murricans
 who are celebrating today instead of last month, anyway) a warm, healthy, and
 happy Secure Your Parents' Wifi Day.
 There are, of course, no outages today, because no one is at work to break 
 anything.
 Cheers,

 I am seeing two AT&T subscribers physically located in Leesburg VA area unable to send or receive voice calls, SMS messages, and packet data. Incoming calls go direct to voicemail, outgoing calls get a "call failed" message displayed on the screen after a long delay. 
 Both subscribers are able to register/camp on UMTS/HSPA. Their MDNs are in 734-260 and 734-323. 
 Is anyone else seeing any trouble like this?

Verizon Business DSL Blip?

 Hi,
 Just received a call from one of my customer located in Cerritos, CA 
 reporting poor network performance and intermittent DNS issue off their 
 Verizon Business DSL connection. Just when I jumped on I noticed packet 
 loss in both direction off VZ and in about a few minutes into 
 troubleshooting the issue cleared up. Of btw, their secondary link to XO 
 was ok.
 Did anyone notice any issue on verizon side in southern california 
 region? Operations is calling in to follow up but just wanted to reach 
 out to see if anyone experienced any weirdness off VZ.

 someone on a DSL support line to analyze beyond the flashy lights can be
 problematic, though.

 Cloudfare believes the routes were withdrawn:
 Beginning at 1026 UTC, routes were withdrawn for PCCW. The routing shifted
 primarily to Turk Telekom. Routes to Telecom Italia and TATA were also
 withdrawn, but has less of an impact. Then, at 1029 UTC, routes were
 withdrawn for Turk Telekom. After that, Syria was effectively cut off from
 the Internet. (Note that the remaining path that appears to be present in
 the video is an anomaly. We have confirmed that it is not actually active.)
 While we cannot know for sure, our network team estimates that Syria likely
 has a small number of edge routers. All the edge routers are controlled by
 Syrian Telecommunications. The systematic way in which routes were withdrawn
 suggests that this was done through updates in router configurations, not
 through a physical failure or cable cut.
 http://blog.cloudflare.com/how-syria-turned-off-the-internet
 BGPMon also talks about routes being withdrawn:
 http://www.bgpmon.net/syria-shuts-down-the-internet/
 I wish those who directly peer with AS29256 would/could share their router
 logs.  Did they see their BGP sessions timeout or were there BGP UPDATEs?

 This is not blocking web, or a kind of traffic.  This is switching off power
 to the routers that connect Syrian ISPs to the rest of the world.  
 For all we can tell, domestic traffic may still be flowing.
 A similar case last year, in Egypt, see: http://bit.ly/65w20v

 FYI they shut everything - cellular access also.
 I tried to reach out to an engineer in country via a contact I have but he
 cant reach them for this reason. I'm guessing they'll find a backdoor at
 some point but right now it seems they didnt.

 We received a voice call via satellite phone approximately 2 hours ago from
 an engineer in country.
 Although the claim is that "terrorists" destroyed the Internet and cellular
 connections, we're all aware the type of concerted effort required to
 disconnect an entire country is likely something only a sovereign
 government would be capable of doing.  Our engineer is working to get out
 of the country as government violence has significantly escalated.

 It is nice to sit outside and talk about backdoors, int'l 3G roaming, satellite, etc., but from in-country, most people probably didn't spend a lot of money - and risk being put in jail or worse! - setting up dishes or the like just in case al-Assad proved to be an even bigger dick than some thought.  (Personally, I'm surprised it took him this long.)
 So, let's just hope this ends quickly - for everyone's sake.  It probably won't take long if he is this desperate.  I hope....

 has anyone tried contacting their  embassy, as when it really were 
 terrorists, they would probably be more than interested in getting some 
 alternative links... a few 622mbit radio links or sattelite transponders
 would already suffice. (too bad for the 12 second rtt but at least it 
 works ;)
 or are we the only ones to have trucks for that purpose :P
 (just how to get them there remains the question ;)

 for your info, the only decent transit pop for most the midddle east seems 
 to be turkey and the rest of them simply have wires going to turkey, which 
 can be blown up, cut in half, hit by a bomb, you name it.
 so the 'terrorist' story is more likely than it seems.

 limited internet back up to its normal somewhat limited state, then we know 
 enough, don't we :P (ie: then they're lying about the terrorists)
 (quite sure the payment would be the least of the issues ;)
 just send them an invoice for a bunch of brand new mercedes zetrosses plus

 Before anyone tell me I know it's not the place for discussion, so it would be my only mail about it :) but if you know  colleague, worker,  friend family or whoever those info can be useful feel free to transmit to them if you ever get a way to reach them, like those using satellite phone.
 I don't manage those link, so I can't guarantee they still work, but they have been activate for the isolate people of Syria.. and I also know even land line have been shut at many place so it could be hard to use.. but maybe it could be useful for someone here..

 not much use, they only have a handful of radio hams there and most of

 Syria off the net
###############################################################
 I guess that was a big surprise that the special operations department 
 was going to release according to the leader of the Syrian electronic army?
 I guess they figured this was the best alternate in order to put an end 
 for the protesters using VPN, Tor, Skype, PGP, and not to mention when 
 their cover got blown about using DarkComet trojan by their very own 
 special operations team.
 Watch your camera fellas ;-)
