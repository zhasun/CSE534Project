GoDaddy secureserver.net SMTP broke?
###############################################################
 For several hours now, I have been getting connections refused,
 connection timeouts, and the occasional "421 #4.4.5 Too many connections
 to this host." for SMTP connections to smtp.secureserver.net and
 mailstore1.secureserver.net.
 Is anybody else seeing this?  Anybody know what's going on?

 I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
 Yes, seeing this at least since 6:00am Pacific.

 Just posted this on mailops.
 =================
 Since about noon central we started seeing email (hosted by GoDaddy) backed
 up for multiple domains across two IP addresses.  Here are the two IPs and
 some sample logged items:
 216.69.186.201
 Open (216.69.186.201) Error 1sec (421 #4.4.5 Too many connections to this
 host.)
 Open (216.69.186.201) Error 180sec (399 TCP Read failed (Err Code Zero after
 180 seconds) 180 sec)
 72.167.238.201
 Open (72.167.238.201) Error 21sec (399 TCP Read failed (Connection timed out
 after 0 seconds) 0 sec)
 It peaked for us around 1 pm Central and is now going down slightly.

 Our CMTS application vendor reported a layer-2 broadcast issue at one of their colo data centers at about the same time. Might be related. 
 I've just gotten email that the issue was resolved. Anyone still experiencing the problem?

 By CMTS do you mean "Cable Modem Termination System", or is it an
 abbreviation for something else?
 The GoDaddy issue appears to be resolved because the backlog has been gone
 for several hours.

 Frank,
 Yes, that's what I was referring to. We use 3rd party vendor to manage our
 cable modems, and the notices I got from them matched up with the times of
 the GoDaddy issues.

 The traceroute doesn't mean much in this case as I get the same output for both mysql.com and oracle.com, yet oracle.com is accessible over HTTP.

 Colleen, your response comes almost 4 hours after the original report:
 23:56 +0000 UTC == 18:56 @ -0500 UTC
 I imagine that's been more than enough time for Oracle to figure out
 what was wrong + resolve it.
 Furthermore, apparently I'm the only one who took the time to look up
 the fact that DNS-wise, www.mysql.com is a CNAME with a record TTL of
 300 seconds, so it may be possible that DNS-based load-balancing is
 involved.  mysql.com's SOA indicates a serial number of 2012090604,
 which (if you go purely off of the serial as a timestamp), indicates its
 been updated roughly 4 times today (09/06, Pacific Time).
 TL;DR -- Oracle would be the only source of truth regarding this outage.

FairPoint NNE / Cogent outage
###############################################################
 Looks like FairPoint NNE (serving ME, NH, and VT) is having trouble again with their peering with Cogent. I see significant packet loss between Cogent and FairPoint. This is a repeat of the event on July 3rd.
 FairPoint has been notified by a couple of their customers (not sure how they handle these kinds of tickets internally).
 Austin
 We have a site in Auburn ME down for 15+ hours. Fairpoint is reporting it
 is due to a fiber cut with no ETR. Not sure if this is related.

 Looks like a problem inside godaddy as I can trace into their network but
 the last hop appears to be unreachable

 It appears to be more than just their premium DNS service - I am not able to get responses from various ns??.domaincontrol.com nameservers that I have queried as well.

 Just actually replied to a customer, looks like a lot of domaincontrol.com

 I am also seeing thing DNS related with godaddy failing. Which in turn 
 is causing clients who host with us to have there sites go off-line due 
 to the DNS issues.
 I am still digging here. But there whois server isn't getting resolved. 
 I was able to hit the IP directly by getting it from Google's resolver. 
 But then after that I tried to dig directly to some of the DNS server 
 specifically NS19.DOMAINCONTROL.COM  ( 216.69.185.10 )
 And get no reply on the requested domain.
 Sincerely
 Mark

 Its more than just Premium DNS.  We're seeing a slew of customer domains
 going dark, all of which are hosted on any number of
 nsxx.domaincontrol.comauthoritative servers.

 My WAGs would be bridge loop or internal/external routing fubar, in that 
 order.  The bridge loop looks kind of DDoSish at first, depending on where 
 you're looking, because all the traffic looks normal enough, except the 
 quantity, and it very quickly gets to the point where interfaces are 100% 
 full and CLIs become unusably lagged.

 It's the easy answer to avoid admitting they where DDOS, when you can't explain something or you don't want to admit something blame it on "corruption"
 The outages start and stop at the time predicted by the hacker who "admit" it.. how could that happen.. coincidence ?

 I'm not surprised Go-Daddy went in the direction of "internal network events that corrupted router data tables". It is definitely the lesser of the two evils. To come out and admit they were hacked or experienced a DDOS would make Customers feel their information on Go-Daddy servers was potentially compromised. Hence the CEO's statement, " At no time was any customer data at risk or were any of our systems compromised."
 Unless there's a government investigation, which is doubtful, none of us will really ever know what truly happened.

 More specifically: there was ICMP packet loss on the DNS servers, and
 it was partial, at about 90%-95%. This suggests saturated ports. Like
 Patrick has said, there are no flows anywhere that suggest it was a
 volumetric DDoS attack on their servers. This means it was either some
 sophisticated zero-day layer 7 attack on DNS servers (doesn't sound
 very likely to me... why would GoDaddy be the target of something like
 that?), or there was just an internal technical issue.
 There will always be people who wildly speculate and then grasp onto
 those theories regardless of any evidence that suggests otherwise, but
 I hope that on a list of network professionals we can put that sort of
 speculation to rest.

 I'm afraid I must agree with Darius here, although I would not have put it exactly like that.
 First, I do not know any network who would rather admit they made an error and denied service to customers than say they were being attacked by someone else.  There is no network on the planet which is immune to DoS.  (Well, almost no network <wink-wink>. =)
 I'm confused why anyone would think that "DDoS" == "customer data breech".  I'm even more confused why anyone would be worried about someone getting access to records which are intentionally published as publicly and as widely as possible.
 There is no evidence of a DDoS, there is multiple admissions of internal error, and other anecdotal evidence points at same.
 Absent other data, I think we should put this thread to rest and wait for GoDaddy to have time to put together a proper RFO.  (And please no comments about the time they are taking.  If you have ever had a major outage and needed to write up an official RFO, you would understand it is not a 12 hour process.)

 It's been a few years since I last heard about route injection (at
 DefCon, wasn't it?) so I don't know whether or not it's widely
 possible, or at least plausible in the case of GoDaddy.

 I don't think this is the case. I've done my own (rudimentary)
 analysis, and their routers were unaffected as far as the BGP DFZ
 is concerned (check http://bgplay.routeviews.org or http://bgp.potaroo.net
 against their route announcements and you won't see any unusual
 activity). Normally, NANOG tends to be quick on routing issues if
 they affect the Internet, but everyone seemed to be more focused
 on the DNS issues at the time. Some actually claiming connectivity
 (albeit intermittent) by IP.
 Going from what they've said, chatter on the Internet (and on this
 list), and the conjectures this is what I've concluded:
 If it were a BGP issue, it would have to be an incredibly nasty iBGP problem. The nature of the problem would've had to shown intermittent connectivity as there are posted traceroutes (under this subject thread) during the outage showing reachability to GoDaddy. Having said that, to take 5-12 hours to recover doesn't really sound accurate at all, even if it was a misconfiguration. Diagnostics and active monitoring software which undoubtedly they have in place can usually pinpoint the problem. But supposing they don't have their act together at all, it's still a more convenient excuse than the alternatives.
 If it was a security breach, this will surmount to more negative publicity, media outlets spreading information, and basically scaring off their customer base. They also participate in the browser CA oligarchy, so I imagine people would think twice before purchasing an SSL certificate from GoDaddy.
 If it was a DoS/DDoS attack, they're basically admitting their capacity and equipment is inadequate. Competitors will target their customer base claiming they're DDoS resilient (which for the most part is BS marketing), and they will probably lose a hearty chunk of customers.
 Lastly, GoDaddy may have no understanding or comprehension of the events that occured during the outage, outside of what we already know. This could be plausible assuming they weren't retaining logs of all their network devices, or did not have enough information (such as storing netflow data during a DoS/DDoS).
 I'm not going to argue that spreading disinformation is ethical or unethical given the circumstances, but I assume it would be the safest position for the company. Also given that two of their employees, in this list, are quick to promise they wouldn't spread disinformation, it just makes everything seem more suspicious. Also, every announcement is quick to denounce that the outage is due to a security breach or DoS/DDoS attack. This just seems to be a tactic to save face, and to avoid blowback from media outlets that could pick it up, sensationalize it, and result in more negative press.
 At least by claiming it was their fault either intentionally or unintentionally, they can at least regain customer confidence and goodwill, dish out a bunch of service credit, and everyone can forget about it. But, from all the discussions so far, and what they've actually said, nothing adds up. In any case, the best bet is to wait for more information.

 As stated this was not a DDoS or a hack.  The statements released by GoDaddy were
 100% true.  I am a network engineer and a part of your community so I wouldn't risk
 deceiving the group.  It was a really bad day for us as we take great pride in our
 network and the internet as a whole.

GoDaddy DNS issues?
###############################################################
 For the last 15 minutes we've seen 12 customer domains using GoDaddy
 authoritative DNS servers go dark.  One came back.  Nothing on the GoDaddy
 Twitter feed other than a mention of "problems with their site" about 30
 minutes ago.  Anyone else seeing this?

Wide Open West - Michigan
###############################################################
 So, in amidst all this craziness with GoDaddy today, I also noticed that
 Wide Open West, at least in parts of Michigan, is not responsive. A couple
 of our clients' connections went down at the same time, and I can't get
 through to WOW's 888 number. Can anyone else replicate/reproduce these
 issues?

 Yes and no... I suspect a lot of individuals relying on GoDaddy (and other large providers) for DNS hosting *assume* that a large, established provider is going to engineer a highly available solution, and that GoDaddy has taken the appropriate steps to ensure diversity of their DNS hosts.
 Of course, we all know that's not true... there is no such thing as "too big to fail". A highly effective DDOS attack can bring large providers to their knees. Personally, I typically replicate DNS for domains I deal with across multiple providers to avoid collateral damage when an upstream DNS provider goes dark (i.e. secondaries across diverse providers). YMMV.

 Clearly you have never run a network.  (Although there are ways GoDaddy could have ensured no single ASN could take out their service, but that is another matter.)
 Also, I know of no backbone provider who saw large flows towards the affected name servers.  While there is clear selection bias here, I am reasonable confident that I would have seen or heard of a large scale attack. 
 So believe as you please.  I am going to take GoDaddy at their word.  And I'm going to give them credit for owning up to the mistake, in public.

Interoute issue in London
###############################################################
 Interoute are having a major issue in London - we're seeing it affect 
 several circuits from them.
 I believe they have multiple master tickets open (one for each team), 
 but one is 1-500518083.
 An engineer should have arrived on site approximately an hour ago.
 Their call centre is *very* busy - been in a queue for about 25 minutes 
 now trying to get an update.

 Maybe try and MTR or some other hop-by-hop analysis and see if it's a
 bad path to 4.2.2.2 or some other link in-between.
 Yup, looks lossy and not normal.

 I can reproduce it over here as well. Maybe Level 3 is finally getting sick
 of people using it for ping testing after all these years? :)

 4.2.2.2 is an anycast address, so any answer to this will likely depend on
 exactly where you are, and which 4.2.2.2 you are hitting...

 FYI - Dug little deeper, maybe coincidence but right about the same

 I have graphs that shows spike in DNS response time off PUCK :)

 4.2.2.x are *authoritatively* multicast; I have that from someone who
 is involved in running recursive DNS for whatever the hell they're calling
 themselves this year.  :-)
 In other news: not all 6 of those servers will always respond to ping traffic
 even if they're resolving; it's random; presumably they don't want anyone
 to get too settled into using them as a ping beacon to watching the weather
 on the 'net.  Understandably.
 Cheers,

 My understanding is that they're not supported *for anyone who isn't a 
 direct customer of GTE/BBN/L3*; they *are* the customer resolver servers for
 their direct end-user customer base.  But that's not evidence, just my 
 understanding.

 Subject: [outages] Packet loss to 4.2.2.2
 Is anyone seeing any issues to 4.2.2.2?
 At 3:35 EST I starting seeing packet loss (icmp ping) to it -  http://imgur.com/ITGL1
 I noticed at the same time we had a route change with RR (Time Warner Cable) in Chicago.

Reading Traceroutes (was Re:  Packet loss to 4.2.2.2)
###############################################################
 ----- Original Message -----
 Just a reminder to all:
 intermediate hops on a traceroute may show high packet drops *without that
 router actually dropping any real traffic packets*.  Many routers are 
 required by their design to force ICMP traffic up into the CPU, where actual
 packets may remain down on the much more efficient cross-linecard-path, which
 means that if the router gets too busy doing "Real work", the ICMP will be 
 the first thing to go.
 Evidence of this is usually a large degree of packet loss which starts and
 ends with one hop in your trace; if *everything past a certain point* seems
 to be dropping roughly the same percentage of traffic, *that* is probably
 the outbound link from the router.
 Cheers,

 Bingo. Traceroute is not a true indicator of packet loss; ping on the other hand would be so long as the endpoint or intermediate endpoints aren't interfering with the flow and don't icmp rate limit.
 In any case, I would like to point an excellent resource for interpreting
 traceroute results from NANOG47:

Problems reaching Twitter from Uverse SF Bay Area
###############################################################
 Anyone else seeing this?  Packet loss is so high the web page won't even load.  Other destinations seem to be just fine.  Looks like Uverse reaches Twitter via Level3 who apparently peers with Twitter at what looks like 11 Great Oaks.  Problem was getting progressively worse all morning until about an hour ago.  Not sure if the problem is with Uverse or Level3 in San Jose.

 And my reason for posting is that if is a Level3 peering issue with Twitter, the problem may be more widespread than just Uverse customers in the SF Bay Area.  Other destinations reached via Level3 from Uverse seem to be ok.
 And ... it's back to normal operation after about 6 hours of not working.  Whoever fed the squirrel, thanks.

 I can't even resolve www.chase.com - looks like the DNS servers for
 chase.com are all located in 159.53.0.0/16 (which belongs to JP Morgan
 Chase)
     ns1.jpmorganchase.com 159.53.46.53

 Don't think it's quite that simple -- their account management page (chaseonline.chase.com) is on the same subnet and is reachable. Seems to be isolated to the homepage.

 Working for me (SF Bay, Comcast).  DNS resolves and page loads.
 www.chase.com is a CNAME for wwwbcchase.gslb.bankone.com.
 downforeveryoneorjustme.com says it's up now too.

 Access is still intermittent from Dayton, OH.  Only information I've 
 found on the issue thus far:
 JPMorgan Chase spokesman Patrick Linehan said, "We're experiencing 
 intermittent issues with Chase.com. We apologize for any inconvenience 
 and are working to restore full connectivity.

 Still down (http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.chase.com =>
 It's not just you! http://www.chase.com looks down from here).
 But this is no surprise, so I am really not sure why this is a network
 [outages] subject. Chase's systems are notorious for failing, for days
 in a row, every few months.

Metro & North Atlanta (AT&T Metro-Ethernet Outage)
###############################################################
 Any other operator seeing a massive AT&T metro-ethernet outage in the Atlanta territory?
 Appears to have started at roughly 11:50AM with partial recovery at 12:15PM and back out of service at 12:16:15PM.
 We are also being informed that this has affected some national broadcast video traffic (IP) transport as well.

 There is.  Parts of AT&T's Metro Ethernet is down in Atlanta.  Likely Qwest uses them for something.

 Every AT&T rep I've ever dealt with on their Metro E offering says that AT&T
 does not guarantee any kind of redundancy in their Metro E network.  That's
 probably there to protect their more expensive offerings like SONET, etc.

 Update from ATT with more details:
 The issue has been isolated to a LAG bundle between two 7609 routers
 in Atlanta and ATS is isolating the offending VLAN so issue can be
 mitigated. Network teams have identified the traffic is impacting
 ATLNGACS4CW. The source of the traffic has been traced back to
 ATLNGAPP4AW. Network teams are attempting to back trace the source of
 the traffic on ATLNGAPP4AW to either another router or an access
 circuit on this device. Troubleshooting through the network continues
 to locate the root source of the VLAN loop. This is a process of
 removing LAG bundles and core trunks from service until the CPU and
 traffic normalize. The process is underway with ATS and the Cisco is
 being engaged for additional support.  There is no ETTR at this time.

 Our NOC is reporting that all of our metro-ethernet circuits were restored at 3:40:34PM (Eastern). 
 Started with slight packet-loss on return to service and a little bit of latency as I would probably expect based upon the methodology in which AT&T is utilizing to troubleshoot/resolve the issue.
 AT&T has not confirmed continuity as of yet so i'm assuming they are still isolating the issue even though traffic is passing.

 There is an ongoing discussion in the citizens weather observer community that ftp might be being blocked by Comcast? Can anyone confirm this is really the case? Allegedly  started at 6:30am today.  Sorry I cannot provide technical examples. I do not have Comcast at my current location.

 Are you talking about outbound FTP (e.g. client on Comcast trying to FTP
 to a server on the Internet), or are you talking about inbound FTP (e.g.
 client on the Internet trying to FTP to a server hosted on a Comcast
 residential connection)?  The direction matters.
 1. Comcast does not filter outbound FTP requests (Comcast->Internet)
 2. Comcast does not usually filter inbound FTP requests
 (Internet->Comcast), however if the customer is a residential customer
 this is not permitted per TOS).  If the customer is commercial/business
 then no filtering is done.
 In the case of a residential customer hosting a server, if Comcast finds
 this, they usually deploy filtering at the cable modem level (by pushing
 out an updated cable modem config to the customer which is picked up via
 TFTP + rebooting the modem remotely).
 There is no way around this aside from talking to Comcast on the phone
 or moving the server to another port (which is not advisable on
 residential connections as Comcast would probably terminate service in
 this situation).
 I can confirm on residential connections that *normally* Comcast does
 permit inbound FTP traffic reaching the customer.  Below is from tcpdump
 on my router (on Comcast), where the client is trying to connect to my
 Comcast IP on TCP port 21.  As you can see, the SYN does arrive:
 09:05:49.737352 IP 209.126.140.25.57088 > 67.180.84.87.21: Flags [S], seq 31607697, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 6,sackOK,TS val 3722921725 ecr 0], length 0

 Perhaps if there is a block on servers, it's selective (heavy user, etc). They're not blocking me.

 Thanks for all the replies, didn't mean to cry wolf.  I don't have Comcast at my location so I cannot test.
 We'll have to look elsewhere for the cause.

 There is an ongoing discussion in the citizens weather observer community that ftp might be being blocked by Comcast? Can anyone confirm this is really the case? Allegedly  started at 6:30am today.  Sorry I cannot provide technical examples. I do not have Comcast at my current location.

 I can honestly say that all the ports blocked on that list have a
 legitimate reason. Kudos to Comcast for actually caring.

 Calls are completing for me now.  The CSR said my card didn't work because
 the merchant provider wasn't working (MC) and that they're using a
 different one for Discover.

L3 cut in Baton Rouge?
###############################################################
 Sorry, no details, but I'm hearing about a fiber cut on Level 3, near baton Rouge.
 --Chris
 Confirmed. From the L3 portal:
 Network Event Summary:	 A suspected fiber cut in Sorrento, LA is
 impacting unprotected services.
 Event Ticket ID:	 5958781
 Market Area Affected:	 Sorrento, LA
 Ticket Create Date:	 9/25/12 7:27:24 PM GMT
 Impacted For:	2 hours 13 minutes
 Event Status:	 Active
 Resolve Date:	
 Time Since Last Update:	30 minutes
 9/25/12 8:47:58 PM GMT
 Global Field Services advised that road construction crews digging in
 the area have caused a possible pinch to the fiber. Global Field
 Services states that a backhoe is en-route to the site to excavate and
 access the fiber to further analyze the damage. An ETA of 21:15 GMT
 for the backhoe to be onsite was provided. No estimated time to
 restore is available.
 9/25/12 8:29:51 PM GMT
 The Field Technician shot the fiber from the Baton Rouge, LA site
 towards Sorrento, LA and found an issue at approximately a
 quarter-mile out from the Baton Rouge site. The Field Technician is
 dispatching to the damage area for further investigation. The Field
 Technician reported that road construction is ongoing in the area and
 suspects that construction crews have damaged the fiber. No estimated
 time to restore is available.

 XO has confirmed with me that they are having a major issue which is also effecting Level 3 at this time.
 Turning down 2828 has resolved our problems here.

 Yes, we are a customer of XO and there is intermittent connectivity.  Possibly a peering issue similar to one that they had back at the first of the year. Notified XO at 955 am MST and there were barely aware of the issue.

 Seems to be a known issue, when visiting pnc.com I get a message titled ?Repairs in progress? saying ?While we're fixing the problem, you can still sign on to Online Banking and other services below.?
 https://www.onlinebanking.pnc.com/ does not seem to be effected (or at least does not have an error page up).
 Looks like they are blocking ICMP at their edge, my trace ends up at  the same path as yours.

Chicago-area Level3 to Amazon AWS EAST-1
###############################################################
 Since approx. 4am CT, we've been seeing 15-30% dropped packets for traffic going from our Chicago Level3 connection to Amazon's EAST-1 data center.  Our San Francisco office (also using Level3) isn't experiencing a problem.  I've re-routed this traffic to our backup Internet connection (Airlogic) for now, and that traffic is getting through just fine.  Anyone else seeing this problem?  Ticket already opened with Level3, waiting to hear back.  Thank you.
 Here's the route my traffic is taking (time outs at the bottom are normal, ICMP gets blocked from that point on).

 George,
 For the future: you need to provide traceroutes from both directions.
 Most routing these days is asymmetric.  Heavily covered here:
 http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog47/presentations/Sunday/RAS_Traceroute_N47_Sun.pdf
 But now that you've "re-routed traffic" (I assume you simply denounced
 and de-peered with your AS3356 peering point?  Or did you physically
 down an interface?), the reverse-path traceroute (from 75.101.163.221 to
 wherever you did the original TCP ping from) won't necessarily be the
 same as when you were being impacted.
 TL;DR -- always provide traceroutes from both directions, and always
 perform this *before* making any routing/peering changes.

 Dunno if this helps or muddies the water.
 I'm seeing an average of 122ms ("http response time") across all 14
 networks (comcast, att, google, verizon, cox, qwest, charter, opendns,
 cablevision, bellsouth, twc, level3) etc) for Amazon EC2 US EAST 1A.
 Narrowing down to LEVEL3, I'm seeing an average of 180ms for http
 response time. However http connect time seems to be around 400ms
 compared to att, cox, verizon and qwest which is about 300ms.
 Doesn't prove anything but thought I bring it up for what I see based
 off external monitor. Sorry no raw data.

 Jeremy, 
 Thank you for the traceroute link.  It was very informative.  To answer your re-route question, I manually entered some routes on my firewall to redirect traffic to my backup ISP's line.
 That said, our service seems to be back to normal.  While I haven't gotten an update on the trouble ticket I have opened with my ISP, another person on this mailing list had reported that his (possibly related) issue had been resolved (a Level3 network issue in Washington).  So I tested again, and now I'm up and running.
 Thanks to everyone for their input.
 -george

 No downtime here via RCN in Chicago; it was always up for me even just
