Ontario Circuit Outages
###############################################################
 Starting around 7:45 AM (-5 GMT) we started receiving alerts that our
 primary and backup AT&T managed WAN circuits in St. Catharines,
 Ontario were down. Based on reports from the office our PRI is also
 down (no SRST). In addition, other businesses in the area are
 experiencing the same issues.
 The only information I have is from one of our employees that spoke
 with a telco worker who said a tree had taken out some fiber.
 Six hours later and we have no ETTR, and AT&T seems to be unaware that
 there is a local/regional issue.
 Has anyone heard anything?
 - Chris
 This would definitely be very regional .... Ontario is a pretty big area ;)
 We have connections up to St. Catherines with no issues .....

Integra Telecom - Las Vegas Nevada

 Seeing large amount of packet loss and high latency on a 100mb internet cirucit on integra telecom out of Las Vegas, Nevada.  Have a ticket opened and they said they are aware of an issue within the network in that city.  Looks like they did a software upgrade last night too so that might be the reason for the outage (speculation of course).

 I reported it on their internal/external tech list, I was seeing the
 outage for about 5-8 min and then it is back working in the last
 5-ish.
 No clue yet what it was, nobody responded to the report yet.  Not a
 hallucination, but transient.

 Several times over the last few years I've seen WP outages which turned 
 out to be bad config pushed in to production and then quickly reverted.  A 
 few were patches to the Mediawiki software, for example.
 I guess they don't have a preprod/UAT environment :)  While I can 
 understand them being able to simulate the scale, a small UAT environment 
 to test config rationality wouldn't go astray.
 I hear Wikipedia has a monitoring system.  It involves alerts issued by 
 millions of people around the world :)

 I know some of the ops folks and have talked about ops stability on
 and off with the deputy director and VP of technology of the Wikimedia
 Foundation.  I haven't professionally consulted per se, but have some
 info about the ops.
 They do have a preprod environment, but there are limitations to it,
 and the systems management process is not perfect.  They have been
 focused over the last couple of years on stability and disaster
 recovery, but with the user growth they see and budget envelope, it's
 hard to make huge leaps ahead on stability while growing.
 Frankly, most of the large commercial environments I have seen were
 run worse, all things considered...

ATT Data outage in Minneapolis area
###############################################################
 Noticed this morning that my phone wasn't able to get onto AT&T's mobile 
 data network; I called ATT and apparently there is an outage in the area 
 that is affecting 10 markets.. I am in the fringe of it in the Savage 
 area.
 The ticket number with ATT is: CM20120804_46235954
 Right now it is sporadic for me; one of my phones will usually work, the 
 other one will usually not work.. but both work at some points.
 No ETR yet; they said the first report was around 9pm yesterday, local 
 time.
 Voice is still working fine.

 Looks like they're having all kinds of problems.
 On IRC, a fiber cut at the Tamba DC is reported.  Workaround is to use the
 https server via wikimedia .

 According to NANOG, Bell Canada leaked a full table, and then Tata turned
 right around and *re*-leaked that full table.

 Hi,
 Looks as if AS46618 ( Dery Telecom Inc) is the root cause of this.
 AS46618, dual homed to bell and videotron, leaked routes learned from
 videotron to bell, which then propagated that to its peers such as Tata.
 Based on BGPMon.net data I see that 107,754 prefixes were affected, i.e.
 leaked via 577 (bell) 46618 (Dery Telecom Inc). Problem started at
 17:27 UTC .
 Cheers,
  Andree

 Rumor is they got hit by a DDoS yesterday that took some of their servers
 off the air for a while.
 Symptoms today seem to match that - ns1 and ns2 at least are both
 responding, but only occasionally and very slowly when they do.

 Not sure what it is yet.  We're totally down there.
 Anyone else have any info?

 Two posts on twitter 28 minutes ago confirm what you're seeing.
 A friend who uses Peer1 in Toronto says that things are really slow, but
 said that there's nothing on Peer1's forum about the issue.

 This was brought up previously on the 9th:
 https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2012-August/thread.html#4141
 Thread name is "IMAP at GMAIL seems down".
 ...where you even commented in the thread:
 https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2012-August/004147.html
 The TCP ports you're testing are non-SSL (plaintext) versions of the
 IMAP and POP3 protocols.  Try the SSL versions instead (993 and 995
 respectively), just like you did in the previous thread.
 Seems fine:
 $ telnet imap.gmail.com 993
 Trying 209.85.225.109...
 Connected to gmail-imap.l.google.com.
 Escape character is '^]'.
 ^]
 telnet> close
 Connection closed.
 $ telnet pop.gmail.com 995
 Trying 209.85.225.109...
 Connected to gmail-pop.l.google.com.
 Escape character is '^]'.
 ^]
 telnet> close
 Connection closed.
 My advice: stop complaining and instead switch to the SSL versions
 already.  Why keep causing yourself grief given the recurring nature of
 this problem?

Level 3 Problems

 Seeing high latency on Level 3 out of northern New Jersey.  We saw very
 slow website loads across many sites and a few page timeouts.  We also see
 high latency between our Abovenet circuit and Level 3 where they peer.
 Level 3 tech support confirms latency problems and did say a lot of
 customers are calling about this. See traceroutes below:

 Subject: [outages] Level 3 Problems
 Seeing high latency on Level 3 out of northern New Jersey.  We saw very slow website loads across many sites and a few page timeouts.

See traceroutes below:

 For such an outage, this kinda fizzled on outages at . For the record, we
 started seeing restored service around 3:30P EDT. Has been pretty stable
 since. Can't wait for an RFO.

 I can confirm this is also causing MMS issues.
 My ATT Galaxy S3 is unable to send or receive MMS messages.
 Network APN contains an MMS proxy and MMS address of
 mmsc.mobile.att.net
 and
 proxy.mobile.att.net
 Both fail to resolve 90% of the time.

Overnight Issues?
###############################################################
 I have reports from our overnight team of access issues, and am trying
 to track it down - as our monitoring reported no problems. I believe it
 is related to our XO transit link, and was wondering if anyone else
 experienced upstream XO issues around the Chicago area last night?
 Thanks -- Steve

Anyone seeing Sprint problems?
###############################################################
 Has anyone noticed any problems with Sprint circuits this afternoon?
 We have four T1s that run from our site in Verona, WI to the Claranet POP in New York.  The alarm lights have been on here in Verona for all four T1s for most of the last couple hours.
 (The last mile is a SONET ring provided by our ILEC, TDS Telecom.  I understand it's entirely possible that the problem could be at our ILEC or the cross connect between Sprint and the ILEC, but I wouldn't expect many on this list to see the problem if it is within our ILEC.  ;-)  )

 Jeremy,
 I picked this up on the list and we had our ILEC and CLEC field resources look into the Calix nodes and hand-off facilities and have no alarms posted at this time. We also have not been contacted by Sprint for any troubleshooting activity either.

 Thanks for checking, Kevin (and another TDS Telecom staff member who replied off-list to offer assistance)...
 We've seen the circuits in service for almost two hours now (since shortly after I sent the first message).  I know that Claranet opened a ticket with Sprint prior to that time.  I'm making the assumption that Sprint fixed a problem and that it was relatively isolated in scope, judging by the lack of "me too" messages on the list.
 If I had any suspicion that the problem was at TDS, I definitely would have called in a ticket.  Your folks are good at checking on things for me, even though these particular circuits technically belong to Sprint.  The lack of unhappy lights on the Calix node pointed me away from suspecting that TDS owned the problem.   ;-)

 Cablevision users are reporting issues getting to sites as well, and 
 Cablevision confirmed it is some routing issue (so says a user).

 Cablevision is having an outage in CT/NY right now -- intermittent
 connections, strange routing, etc. so I'm sure what you're seeing is
 related to that. Here's what we saw before (coming from Sidera in NYC going
 to a site in Stamford, CT - though we're having this with pretty much all
 sites in CT & NY):

Verizon Business (SIP) One-way Audio

 Is anyone experiencing one-way audio on Verizon Business (SIP) service?
 We have multiple customers experiencing this.  The SDP looks fine and we see two-way audio flowing, but one side can't hear anything.  We are confident it is not an issue local to us, but it would be great to get confirmation that it is a larger outage.
 If we re-route to Level 3 the issue does not happen.

 =================================================================
 If our customers having problems were on DSL I'd never have posted.  8-)   They would be considered "off-net".  We have very few off-net customers since we can't control QoS for those customers.
  Relaying from another group - they had a master ticket open on this one-way audio issue and were already working on it when I asked about it (a little after 10) I got the impression it was a fairly isolated issue.
 Sorry for the delay in replying, I did want to confirm: it's not you, it's us :)

TWC outages
###############################################################
 Time Warner seems to be having an issue affecting all accounts in the 
 North East, as per their support line.
  From 14:45 - 15:00 EST we saw packet loss and high latency on our fiber 
 circuit to them. Additionally, phone service provided over coax 
 experienced a total outage.
 As of 15:00 the packet loss has ceased and dial tone is back, however, 
 latency is very high (100ms - 800ms) to locations outside the TWC network.
 FYI.
 Not effecting me near Dayton Ohio going through Cleveland Ohio.

 The status page on linode indicates it's a power issue.
 Power has been restored and they're working to bring all associated nodes back online.

 3:52pm (EDT): NAC has informed us of a power issue affecting at least
 some portion of the datacenter. As soon as power is restored we are
 poised to execute our recovery procedures to all affected systems.

 This is the incident report from NAC:
 Subsequent to the utility power failure at our Cedar Knolls facility
 the generator that powers systems A and D did not start automatically.
 Manual intervention was required to get generator power running.
 Unfortunately before the generator was manually engaged customers on
 these systems experienced a complete power loss. We are still
 investigating why the generator did not engage automatically.Utility
 power has been restored, and transfer back to utility was successful.

 Didn't something similar with NAC happen back in April?

 I'm noticing a common trend here.

 Yes, of course, but usually with big facilities that runtime is in
 minutes, not hours. Or seconds for the flywheel types. And when big
 breakers or big engines decide to act up they do so quite stubbornly.
 The larger the system the longer it takes to fix a fault even if you
 know exactly what's wrong.
 In any case, even if there is hours and hours of battery runtime, what
 does it matter if the air handlers are off?
 ~Seth
 The fault was related to an automatically operated circuit breaker on one of several generators. It would not close automatically, and had to be persuaded, which took some time. Further details will be made available to customers as soon as the post-event investigation is complete.

 It is common to have not only strings of batteries but an ATS, or automatic transfer switch. In this case, it sounds like the fault was on the ATS side of the plant based on the IR below.
