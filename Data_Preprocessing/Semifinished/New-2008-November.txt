peering in LA between XO and Savvis
###############################################################
 We are seeing large (20-30%) packet loss in the forward and reverse path 
 from XO to Savvis in the Los Angeles peering point. This was happening 
 yesterday for about 2 hours, and has picked back up this morning. This 
 has made some sites hosted in Savvis unusable for us (like Netsuite).
 Appropriate traces (some hops stripped to protect the innocent):

 After working with both vendors, it seems that a DDoS attack, aimed else 
 where, which transited XO's peering router in LA was the root cause of 
 this issue.
 Seems to be cleared up now.

 Word is brownout, battery backups didn't kick in and a core router went 
 down.  No word on recovery time or anything else at this point.

 Human error.  They were bypassing UPS A for maintenance and there was

 So far the only data that I have from them was that they were trying to
 make a change with Level3 and "something happened."
 I have progressed this to my sales team in an effort to get more
 information.

 We have had no luck dealing with level3, they claim it's part of an OC12 outage, but they have no details, won't callback and no ETR.

 The parent ticket is #3020259. Other than that, just some very non-specific info. Something about a "missing cross-connect", which they have been stating for over 12 hours now. If it was just missing, dispatch a tech and fix it already.

 This could be completely unrelated (especially given that this is west
 of Mississippi), but there was a Abovenet and Level 3-confirmed fibre
 cut near Houston yesterday afternoon (~1300 PST), which was affecting
 eastward traffic (e.g. Houston-->Atlanta).  That fibre was repaired at
 approximately 2100 PST.

 Quite possibly a different issue, or part of some planned migration. Since I haven't been able to get any details, I have no clue. There is someone else on the Nanog list who was given the same explanation  as us and he is in Wyoming.

 This is fourth-hand, but this was posted on the NANOG list:
 There are also reports they are advertising routes they don't have, possibly because of the backbone outage.
 The Internet Health Report (http://www.internetpulse.net/) definitely sees some flakiness.

 Sprint's own performance map is showing 7% to 8% packet loss out of St. 
 Louis.

 My posting about Sprint was from Friday.  Our upstream provider re-peered
 with them Sunday at 1 am.

 This is fourth-hand, but this was posted on the NANOG list:
 There are also reports they are advertising routes they don't have, possibly
 because of the backbone outage.
 The Internet Health Report (http://www.internetpulse.net/) definitely sees
 some flakiness.

 Funny how when you look at:
 https://www.sprint.net/performance/
 everything seems OK, but IHR reports differently. ;)

 It's coming and going.  Here's a traceroute from my border router to sprint.net from Hawaii across Qwest.  But right afterward the site was reachable.

 I gave Sprint a call regarding today's problems and it seems they have 
 more than one thing going on; there's some kind of DNS issue and 
 "multiple BGP issues on core routers" after I mentioned I was a 
 multihomed customer and their DNS problems wouldn't impact me. I wasn't 
 able to coerce any other details out of them.
 ~Seth
 Our upstream provider also mentioned Sprint DNS issues in addition to
 Sprint's routing issues.
