 Anyone aware of issues between AT&T and Level3 ?   We are connecting
 to Level 3 in Detroit.  http://www.internetpulse.net confirms issues.

 We connect into Level(3) in detroit too. Want me to run any traceroutes from my side to help you isolate anything?
 We haven't received any complaints, but we have two other carriers so we might just not be seeing the problem.

 Bill,

 Looks to me like this might be an issue with Level(3)/ATT peering in Chicago.
 I do have one customer complaint of intermittent connectivity which might be related to this issue, but I don't have an IP from them to test yet.

Lightower/Sidera - NYC
###############################################################
 Anyone else seeing any issues in NYC with Lightower/Sidera?  Starting
 around 6:05AM (EST) we saw heavy packet loss across their network (from
 Sidera legacy) and some of our point to points bounce. The P to P's have
 some what stabilized (though we've seen a couple more bounces since then)
 the IP side of things have been pretty much unusable (we shut our session
 down.)  It also looks like their phone system is having a problem - calls
 into them seem to drop after trying to connect to the NOC - which I'm sure
 is pretty busy.

 Similar experience for me. IP is down and I get a busy signal when I call their NOC.

 We use them for L2 transport between Nycm and BSTP. It started taking
 errors at approx. 6:05am EST. Thankfully this is just a protect path for us.
 Calling their NOC results in busy signals or just dead air.

 LightTower/Sidera master ticker for this is LT1323725.
 I was able to get through their support line now.
 The ETR is 1-2 hours from now.

 I contacted their NOC about 45min ago. They have stated they are still
 working on resolution. They have reports about some services being
 functional, while other still experiencing packet-loss and latency. It does
 not sound like they have been able to identify the root cause and are still
 troubleshooting.
 Here is the number I
 ? used to get through to their NOC: 888-583-4237, option 1. From there,
 just follow the prompts.
 Fwiw, my customer circuit from NYC to NJ is still affected.

 Anyone else seeing any issues in NYC with Lightower/Sidera?  Starting 
 around 6:05AM (EST) we saw heavy packet loss across their network (from 
 Sidera legacy) and some of our point to points bounce. The P to P's have 
 some what stabilized (though we've seen a couple more bounces since then) 
 the IP side of things have been pretty much unusable (we shut our session 
 down.)  It also looks like their phone system is having a problem - calls 
 into them seem to drop after trying to connect to the NOC - which I'm sure 
 is pretty busy.

 I contacted their NOC about 45min ago. They have stated they are still working on resolution. They have reports about some services being functional, while other still experiencing packet-loss and latency. It does not sound like they have been able to identify the root cause and are still troubleshooting.
 Here is the number I? used to get through to their NOC: 888-583-4237, option 1. From there, just follow the prompts.
 Fwiw, my customer circuit from NYC to NJ is still affected.

 Confirmed here as well, 7 out of 7 L2 tail circuits not passing traffic after a good hour of instability.
 FWIW, I don't recall any recent maintenance announcements from them, so this is a bit troubling (I'd expect this if we saw a big rollout of new code the night previous) since it came out of the blue.  I can also confirm we saw our first outage much earlier than they acknowledged, one circuit lost connectivity at 5:23 a.m.  I can also confirm that we did not see the physical layer go down once on any of our circuits, this seems to be occurring in the core, not the rings that actually service the buildings.
 We're legacy ConEd/RCN/Sidera, have no idea if this is happening with the LT network or not.
 We got what appears to be a bogus "all restored" email at 2:50 p.m.

 This outage is still on-going. I spoke with an executive at LT earlier
 today and the word then was that some downstream customer of the
 Sidera/ConEd/RCN legacy network is leaking PVST BPDUs and its wreaking
 havoc on their network. I'm not sure how legitimate that is anymore
 since its been several hours. Apparently though, since our circuits
 are fluctuating up and down every few minutes, it would seem they're
 not very close to resolution. We're approaching the 12 hour mark for
 certain circuits.
 They also don't seem to have any tools to notify/communicate with
 their customers about the on-going efforts..and they don't tweet
 anything but marketing crap. The management of this incident is
 asinine.

 Thanks James. I was told of some sort of packet storm causing the outage on their MPLS network. Maybe these BPDUs have spanning tree going haywire. Maybe they had to isolate some PEs from the network and all of us are on those PEs?

 Anyone else seeing any issues in NYC with Lightower/Sidera?  Starting around 6:05AM (EST) we saw heavy packet loss across their network (from Sidera legacy) and some of our point to points bounce. The P to P's have some what stabilized (though we've seen a couple more bounces since then) the IP side of things have been pretty much unusable (we shut our session down.)  It also looks like their phone system is having a problem - calls into them seem to drop after trying to connect to the NOC - which I'm sure is pretty busy.

 Likely related to the fiber cut they experienced on their network earlier this week which they routed around.

 Any insight into a Windstream ISP outage in NE Ohio? My EoC services are out but my fiber services are fine.
 Looks like outage began around 1/1:30pm EST. Not sure if Hudson or Cleveland NOC.
 Was told "a few hours" on outage.

Voip Innovations down hard outage Public Ticket # 77895
###############################################################
 VI NOC is aware of an issue that is affecting both inbound and outbound
 calls on our network. Our engineers are actively looking into this and
 updates will be provided as more information becomes available. This issue
 is affecting calls across all carriers at this time. Please do not respond
 to this ticket as it for informational purposes only. We will communicate
 with you through this public ticket by providing updates as more
 information becomes available.
 Our engineers continue to work this issue with our switch vendor. We still
 do not have an ETR but have been working diligently to correct the problem.
 Please understand that a lack of updates does not mean the issue is not
 being investigated. Contrarily, this is our top priority and will continue
 to be so until it is resolved. We had updated several times earlier in this
 ticket that we thought it was nearly cleared because at the time we felt
 that was the case. We will provide any additional information as it becomes
 available but we want to reiterate that this issue is actively being worked.
 by: RandyS
 --11/7/2013 11:53:00 PM
  We have received word that our switch vendor will be performing rolling
 restarts across some of our network equipment. They will be assessing the
 affect of this on an ongoing basis once this has completed and we will
 provide additional updates as information becomes available.

 We have multiple customers on the east coast who are unable to utilize our
 NY server for voip. They are getting no audio and there are non responses
 to our invites to them.
 Some of them have failover routes to our LA server and that seems to be
 working fine. Rerouting inbound DIDs through our LA server solves the issue
 as well.
 It doesn't seem to be a DNS issue as a customer was using IP addresses
 because of DNS issues before, he was still having problems.
 It seems to affect multiple ISPs, as there were customers from brighthouse,
 time warner, AT&T who were having problems.

 Thanks Jason
 Could be a coincidence on the endpoints, trouble may be on another network in the path I suppose.
 Most of our stuff is on East coast so we're just sitting it out for now rather than rerouting. We don't see a reason to do anything drastic at this point.
 For reference, our affected products are also VoIP, not sure if it is relevant.

 Seeing much weirdness with RR networks, mostly in NYC. Long routing paths, maybe some blackholed traffic, etc.
 They have confirmed an issue, not saying much more (yet).
 Others seeing same thing?

 We were seeing Time Warner Cable connected users on the East Coast/Midwest having trouble accessing a few networks of ours. Traceroutes to our networks from Time Warner were all over the place. We?re located in MN.
 It seems to have recovered in the past 10 minutes or so though.

 Does anyone have anything yet from TW? I have no direct relationship with

 Haven't seen anything yet. Our NOC guys will forward to me when they receive and I can give a synopsis.
 Troubles seem to have cleared though which is good.

 We saw about 40 min of downtime early this morning (~12:00am - 12:40am CST)
 on one of our level3 bgp circuits in the Dallas, TX area and received this
 communication from level3:
 Level 3 Communications will implement scheduled maintenance to perform
 software upgrades as part of a large project on the Level 3 Transport
 network, involving several GCRs over several nights. There is a potential
 that the same circuit will be impacted across multiple GCRs. This work is
 being done in order to provide fixes and features currently unavailable as
 well as to maintain current software loads on our network equipment. This
 software upgrade is service affecting for Ethernet services terminating to
 the devices undergoing this upgrade.
 The typical impact ranges from 30 to 230 seconds, with an expected outage
 of no more than 5 minutes. If you experience a greater than 5 minute impact
 to your services please contact the Technical Service Center at
 1-877-4LEVEL3.
 Updates
 This window of this maintenance has completed successfully.

 Verizon 4G LTE in Northeast Ohio is getting a perpetual loading icon on the web interface.
 API seems to be working, though, as I can search and load videos via 3rd party apps like Jasmine.

 Google Front End.
 It?s also the ?GFE? in the recent NSA slide that?s been bandied about, which is what initially shined some light onto the topic.
 To my understanding it?s a google-specific webserver implementation that does ?google magic? to speak to various services on the backend. 
 http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ws-gfe/all/all shows a bit about it, but the term is apparently vanishingly hard to google for.

verizon issues?
###############################################################
 Is anyone out there seeing unusual troubles with Verizon? I
 am seeing issues that are changing rapidly, so traceroutes
 are not too useful.  I get completely different results (all
 broken one way or another) on traceroutes 10 minutes apart to
 the same IP.  For example 4.4.4.2.
 Please don't fill the list with "me too" or "no trouble from X".
 Send them to me and, if there's interest, I will summarize for
 the outages-discussion later.
 Thanks,
 scott
 One more thing before I get flamed too much.  I can't get 
 any BGP info from the network I'm currently on and many 
 resources to get that and other normal outages-list 
 troubleshooting info are on the mainland are at best 
 intermittently available.
 scott
 It's apparently over.  It seemed to be with alter.net in
 Calif.  Maybe where the Hawaii traffic lands in general?
 Perhaps that's why I got only one response.  I guess the 
 RFO is post to outages-list and poof, the internet heals 
 itself.  ;-)  Filed in the <shrug> folder...

Power loss at CAT Towers, Bangkok Thailand
###############################################################
 Apparently protesters have cut electricity to CAT (communications authority
 of thailand) towers in Bangkok and have taken over the diesel generators.
 The building is without power and most international links going out via
 CAT would be down.
 CAT is the biggest international internet gateway in Thailand.
 Cant find news reports about this yet. Above info is based on what thai
 people have told me based on reading tweets.
 http://internet.nectec.or.th/internetmap/map/internationalmap/inetmap102013_international.jpg
 "CAT-IIG" is down for sure. Not sure if any of the others are located in
 the same building or not.

 Anti-government protestors in Bangkok, Thailand, apparently unaware that their own Internet media, television, and social media use would be negatively affected, shut off electrical power to the main Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) IDC & PoP in the Bangrkak district of Bangkok, and also removed the control system for on-site generators and UPSes serving the facility.  Thousands of Thai Web sites and international Web sites hosted in Thailand are currently unavailable, including major corporate sites such as thaiairways.com; the CAT-run International Internet Gateway (IIG) peering PoP has also been affected, leading to disruption of network peering between participating Thai ISPs and other ISPs operating outside Thailand.  Thai ISPs with private and international peering retain global Internet connectivity, albeit with some latency-induced performance issues resulting from longer topological paths for Internet traffic.
 It has been communicated to protest leaders that these actions are counterproductive, given that the protestors themselves are heavily using Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, LINE, and other social media in order to coordinate their activities.  CAT report that they will have new emergency generators deployed within the hour, with police reinforcements to prevent further interruptions of service.
 Pro-government political activists have stated that they are mobilizing ~20,000 supporters (it is important to note that numbers of people are routinely exaggerated by all political groups in Thailand) in order to guard the CAT facility against renewed intrusions by protestors.

 Seems like CAT gateway is back online. Trace to my Singapore box from True
 is going thru CAT's gateway and is not lossy.
 For a while in between my ISP True (which operates its own gateways) lost
 all international connectivity for several users(everyone i asked)
 including me. Now that connectivity is restored interwebs is working better
 than ever (fingers crossed).

 Protestors have apparently learned their lesson - disrupt the Internet and they lose the ability to coordinate their protests, heh.
