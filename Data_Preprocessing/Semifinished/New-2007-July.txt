 SAN FRANCISCO, July 24 (Reuters) - Sporadic power outages hit San
 Francisco on Tuesday afternoon, affecting widespread areas including
 the city's downtown financial district.
 About 28,000 customers in San Francisco and an area south of the city
 were affected, said Darlene Chiu, spokeswoman for Pacific Gas &
 Electric Co., the main utility for the city. More than 20,000 of those
 outages were in San Francisco, she said.
 "We are investigating the cause of it," said Chiu, adding that the
 utility is having on-and-off success in reconnecting customers by
 backup circuits.
 Traffic signals in much of downtown San Francisco were not working.
 Bay Area Rapid Transit trains were moving, although some of the lights
 in undergound stations were off, a BART spokesman told local radio.
 The outages began about 2 p.m. PDT, Chiu said.
 The utility is owned by PG&E Corp.

 Heh,
 They have pretty anal security people there, so I tend to disbelieve,
 but I guess anything is possible.
 We lost power to all circuits in one of the colo-rooms there, but not
 another, so it may just be more issues with their power distribution gear.
 They dropped us and a bunch of other customers for several hours in a
 different colo-room last year when a circuit breaker failed.

 365 Main hasn't announced much about Tuesday's outage.
 I saw this on the comments on Laughingsquid.com
 My rack in Colo 7 lost power for 2 minutes. I heard someone else say  
 that they didn't lose power at all in Colo 7.
 Colo 4 supposedly lost power.
 Colo 1 lost power for 20 minutes according to this message.
 Colo 2, 3, 5, 6, 8  - any reports?

 I know of 3 sites in downtown San Francisco without power - apparently

 in the blanks? I'm not in SF today, but I see nothing on sfgate...

 Subject: Cogent outage details?
 am receiving word that Cogent has been the victim of "hardware
 problems on our backbone causing latency and packet loss to customers
 on the east coast". I did manage to get a master ticket number
 (608503), but I'm curious if anybody out there (perhaps an actual
 Cogent customer) has more details - backhoe? operator error?
 evaporating subatomic black hole?
