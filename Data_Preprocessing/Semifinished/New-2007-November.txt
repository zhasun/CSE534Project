DNS outage in Europe (Norway)

 Greetings -
 Can anyone comment on reports of a severe DNS outage in Europe, Norway
 in particular?
 Any information greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance,

 I wonder how a "severe DNS outage in Europe" would look like, though, 
 given the distributed nature of DNS...

 I did not see this one - and probably wont be able to see it
 because open resolvers are frowned upon.
 I did see others earlier:
 The problem I used to see was - the two resolvers the enduser
 sees, were down. People who had their own resolvers or who
 were able to change /etc/resolv.conf were lucky.
 With norway it is very likely that they messed up censoring dns again.
 google "norway dns censoring"
 will very likely give you everything you want to know.
 Apropos
 Norway is one of the countries were customers are easyly convinced
 to change to alternative root-servers :)
 Kind regards

Level3 Issues In Dallas
###############################################################
 Starting around 1730 CST we started seeing 50% packet loss to random
 IP's, going through Level3 Dallas (AS3356) to a Level3/WilTel (AS7911)
 customer in Texas.In a given subnet, it seemed that about half of the
 IP's were fine, while the other half experienced 50% loss, starting at
 Level3's Dallas POP.
 Around 2100 CST we saw severe routing problems between Level3 (AS3356)
 and Level3/WilTel (AS7911). Traffic sent to AS7911 in Texas was being
 handed off to AS3356 in Miami, and other such fun locations (Dallas is
 the exhange point under normal conditions). Currently, Level3 (AS3356)
 Dallas looking glass is unable to ping certain Level3/WilTel (AS7911)
 routers interfaces in Texas.
 There appear to be major problems with Level3 in Dallas this evening.
