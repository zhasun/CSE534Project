 Yes, I believe their Fremont data center may be under a DDoS attack.  Our
 own monitoring system for HE's www.he.net (v6 site) showed several ups and
 downs starting at 4:59 pm Central until 5:42 pm Central  
 This is also being discussed on twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/search/henet

 It is not the first time this week.
 Mike & the team are good engineers, they'll do what they can to bring it backup quickly.
 There are lots of other rumors floating around, but I think you should wait for official word.  HE is not a telco, they will tell you what happened.

 Ongoing DDOS attacks against HE.net router infrastructure.. It's being
 happening since 9/29 now.. With outages of various durations.. 
 Todays outage started at ~15:00:10 PST and has been ongoing since then. All
 IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions with them down currently.

 I pick up transit with HE at Telehouse (25 Broadway).  Traffic flowing 
 through them died after it hit their edge.  Something must be hosed in 
 their core as things got better once I shutdown the session between us.
 I haven't called them to get the scoop, I figure they've probably got 
 their hands full now.

 I am told by a regular poster that a downsized HVAC employee frobbed the Big

 Seems to be working from here.  Our process involves one of our VP's following people out the door.  I'm pretty sure a tank might be afraid of him pissed off... :)  We also have a clause in the "Employment Agreement" that states "Any and all damages and or resolution for damages due to hostile employee actions during or after a dismissal will be billed to the former employee.  Time spent resolving damages will be billed at contractor rates, or internal service billing rates, whichever is higher."  Don't think anyone has ever had to pay fines though :)

XO slowness
###############################################################
 Is anyone seeing general XO slowness this morning? We noticed at approx
 midnight Eastern a drop in traffic on our link to them, and testing
 shows sessions limited to about 1-2Mb/s in the outbound (to XO)
 direction while inbound runs normally. This is per-session, the
 aggregate is still gigs so I don't think it's just an overloaded link
 somewhere. 
 We have redundant links into different core routers within XO's network
 in the Detroit market and we see the same issue with both so I'm pretty
 sure this problem is somewhere further into XO's network than just our
 interconnect to them. Their support number is reporting heavy load and a
 "VoIP services" problem so I'm curious if anyone knows if they are
 having a large-scale IP problem of some kind.

 The issues started at approximately 4 am (EDT). We're trying to fix this as quickly as possible, but don't have an estimate for how

 Reading between the lines it sounds like they really don't want to execute

 When I got through, the NOC reported that the Greentree datacenter had an AC
 outage due to breakers throwing. Around 2AM Eastern time, they said it was
 back on but they were continuing to diagnose the problems. I haven't heard
 anything since.

Fiber cut between Marion and Muncie IN
###############################################################
 In case anyone else is seeing oddities or down circuits that pass through central Indiana, we're aware of a confirmed cut between Marion and Muncie that's affecting some of Zayo's lit services and possibly others.
 OTDR and repair crew in the field, ETR TBD.

 Here's what I received, timestamped 2234 UTC:
 "Fiber Provider Zayo Engineers found the 144 count fiber cut in half by a
 brush hog. Splicers are onsite pulling slack at this time with a
 tentative ETR for lit services of about 4.5 hrs with all others being
 6 to 8 hours."

Facebook Chat
###############################################################
 Facebook has dropped their full-window "popout" chat interface, which was
 deprecated a while back (you could use it if you still had the URL laying
 around, but the link to it was gone)...
 and in the wake of that, I find that their instructions here:
   https://www.facebook.com/sitetour/chat.php
 for setting up XMPP clients like Pidgin to connect to chat no longer work.
 If you use XMPP to chat on Facebook, could you contact me offlist and let me
 know if it a) works, b) just broke, or c) hasn't worked in a while?
 If you work in Facebook Engineering, um... :-)

 Well, this is twice in a row, which is a little bit embarassing.
 I was using the wrong password, folks.  Amazing how much better it works when
 you get that little detail right.  2 days setting up gear in a 68F colo rack
 will kill you, apparently.
 Thanks to several people who looked into this, this afternoon; my apologies
 for the noise.

Level3 routing
###############################################################
 In the Orlando, FL area, via Level3, I'm unable to reach anything of 
 google's (google.com, its NS's 216.239.32.10, 216.239.34.10, 
 216.239.36.10, 216.239.38.10, their 8.8.8.8 DNS service), puck.nether.net, 
 bing.com, and probably lots of other things I haven't checked.
 Traces die at
 146.137.69.4.in-addr.arpa	name = ae-0-11.bar2.Orlando1.Level3.net.
 I'm seeing this both from work, where we have Level3 and TWTelecom, and 
 from home on my BHN cable (which relies heavily on Level3 for transit). 
 At work, shutting our BGP session to Level3 has resolved things...but I 
 hate being singlehomed.  Our NOC claimed they couldn't get through (busy 
 signal) to Level3's NOC, so I just called L3 from my cell, got through, 
 opened a ticket, and the guy I spoke with was unaware of any issues.
 Anyone else seeing this?

 I didn't get the call from our NOC (who heard from Level3's) that things 
 were supposed to be fixed until 0630.  I turned our Level3 BGP back on, 
 and verified that things were back to normal.  Based on traces to what was 
 broken, it looks like there was something wrong between Level3's Orlando 
 and Miami POPs.

 Request for participation - Arbor 2011 Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report. 
 -----
 Folks,
 We're in the process of collecting survey responses for the 2011 Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WWISR); this is the Seventh Edition of the Report, and we'd really be grateful for your participation!  This is the only security-focused survey we're aware of which is specifically oriented towards those who design, build, operate, and defend public-facing network infrastructure/applications/services, and provides an opportunity to share your experiences and perspectives with your peers within the operational community, as well as to benefit from their shared experiences and perspectives.
 The 2011 Infrastructure Security Survey is up and available for your input.  You can register and complete the survey via this URL, which will redirect your browser to the survey tool (the survey itself is accessed via http/s):
 <http://www.arbornetworks.com/survey/ISR2011>
 Once again, we've added several insightful questions from past participants.  Survey collection will end as soon as we've reached the desired number of respondents (ideally, 100+).
 The survey results will be published in the 2011 Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report during January of 2012.  Also, please note that *no* personally- or organizationally-identifiable information will be shared in any manner.
 The 2010 edition of the Report is available here (registration required):
 <http://www.arbornetworks.com/report>
 Thanks in advance!

Level3 in ATL
###############################################################
 Anyone else see Level3 take a dump in ATL around 17:45 UTC?
 We took a dive on our Level3 transit connection there around that time and when I looked at the peering session, it showed up 24weeks but they were only showing us 100K prefixes.  I didn't see this on our Level3 peering sessions in IAD or on the left coast.

 We lost connectivity to out Level(3) colo at 180 Peachtree in Atl for about 12 minutes. 
 Seems to have recovered. Level3 support had no knowledge of an ongoing issue when we called in.

 Hello John,
 We did we as well looks like they had an issue that lasted about an
 hour.  Based on what we saw they dropped all routes that did not
 originate from 3356.

AT&T & Google Issues
###############################################################
 We are noticing a packet loss issue on our AT&T circuit to Google
 service. I have an open ticket with AT&T but they insist that it is a
 google issue.
 We are getting 50% packet loss to both www.google.com and 8.8.8.8.
 These are both taking the same route jumping from AT&T to Google.
 Trace route & pings are good up to 12.94.87.18. AT&T says that is
 google's router even though it is there IP.
 Anyone know how to let google know there is an issue with one of there
 AT&T pipes?

META: Reminder: post the trace
###############################################################
 If you're reporting an outage on the list, and you conducted a traceroute
 that failed, remember to post it at the end of your message; it's usually
 more helpful than not.
 I personally recommend 'mtr -r -c 10' (accompanied with 'mtr -nr -c 10', since
 sometimes you want all the IPs, and that's mtr's one blind spot), but any
 trace is better than none, whether you're reporting a problem, a meetoo,
 or a WFM.
 Cheers,

 You guys know that 4.2.2.[123] are anycast, so you get to different
 servers depending on where you enter the Level3 network, right?
 Mentioning just in case some have missed this.

 I assume that that 4.2.2.1 is anycast, because my own path is different
 (going to Chicago) and good.  Looks like the problem is in Dallas.

 Under normal circumstances, I typically see at least one more hop in front
 of 4.2.2.2, and much lower latency.
  From this, I assume the packet loss I'm seeing is due to a problem within
 Level 3's network. And may be limited to a Dallas link/router, based on
 others' reports.

 Not to possibly point out the obvious, but 4.2.2.2 is an anycast address, so
 you'll be hitting all sorts of different destiantions when trying to trace to
 it, depending on where you are.
 e.g., I tested from a few shells I have around:
 LA:
   6. ae-21-70.car1.LosAngeles1.Le  0.0%     5   10.8  11.8   9.3  18.2   3.6
   7. vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net         0.0%     5    9.7  11.0   9.7  12.6   1.2
 TX:
   6. xe-8-1-0.edge4.Dallas3.Level  0.0%     5    0.6   0.7   0.6   0.9   0.1
   7. ae-31-80.car1.Dallas1.Level3  0.0%     5  163.2 157.8 123.5 181.6  22.2
   8. vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net        80.0%     5   30.0  30.0  30.0  30.0   0.0
 Bay Area (Fremont):
   6. ae-11-60.car1.SanJose1.Level  0.0%     5    2.1   6.0   1.9  22.0   9.0
   7. vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net         0.0%     5    2.0   2.0   1.9   2.1   0.1
 So it seems that (at least) the one in TX might have issues).

 If you're seeing packet loss on pings, please use a tool like mtr to show
 where it's happening.

 About 3pm we lost some major links and are working a ticket with Level3. They are indicating
 It is a likely failed module between Houston and Denton, TX. No ETR at this time.  Not sure it
 Is associated with the intermittent ICP/DNS issues...

Qwest Re-Convergence

 Has anyone noticed issues reaching Qwest destinations around 4:05a-4:07a Mountain Time today? We received alerts that two of our sites that happened to have Qwest connectivity in common were unavailable during that period. Both sites being monitored were in different facilities but both in Boise.

 Ditto. Our side of the /30 we share with Qwest was unreachable from approx 4:05 to 4:12 AM MT. Haven't looked yet to see if our BGP session dropped during that time. If not we (they) were likely blackholing traffic briefly.

 Has anyone noticed issues reaching Qwest destinations around 4:05a-4:07a
 Mountain Time today? We received alerts that two of our sites that happened
 to have Qwest connectivity in common were unavailable during that period.
 Both sites being monitored were in different facilities but both in Boise.

 We have a Qwest MPLS VPN connection in Boise and saw the same drop from 
 04:05 to 04:14 MDT.   BGP did not drop, but GRE tunnels on our router did.

 Ditto. Our side of the /30 we share with Qwest was unreachable from approx 
 4:05 to 4:12 AM MT. Haven't looked yet to see if our BGP session dropped 
 during that time. If not we (they) were likely blackholing traffic 
 briefly.

 I'm monitoring the v6 version of www.twtelecom.com (2001:4870:800d:fe1::11)
 and saw it go down from 1:48 am (Central) to 4:25 am (Central), so
 essentially the same time.

 I don't think I actually checked which prefix we were seeing when connectivity was restored at the time I posted my follow-up.  Right now we are seeing two prefixes from TWTC:
 2001:4870::/31
 2620:81:8000::/48
 (and also 2001:4870:E00B::/48 from a path transiting 4323)
 I don't know for sure whether they were advertising the /31 or /32 before the event this morning but regardless 2001:4870::/32 wasn't reachable in the DFZ (as itself or as a superprefix).  bgp.he.net still shows them advertising a /32, so I suspect they only changed to a /31 very recently - potentially during or after this outage.

 It's possible that the TWTC's customer advertisements are different than
 their peering ones, no?
