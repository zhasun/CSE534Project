cannot resolve ca.gov from Linode default resolvers in Fremont
###############################################################
 Hello,
 There seems to be an outage of ca.gov domain names from within Linode 
 resolvers in Fremont.  I'm not sure what the issue is, because I cannot 
 see there being anything wrong with ca.gov nameservers; nonetheless, the 
 names cannot be resolved through Linode's default resolver.
 It has been more than an hour already as ca.gov cannot be accessed with 
 Linode's default resolvers.
 Cheers,
 Constantine.

 Not the right tests. What you should do:
 1) dig to the Linode resolvers. If the resolver is 2001:db8:1::53,
 then :
 dig @2001:db8:1::53 A ns5.net.ca.gov
 then the same with +cd (I don't know if Linode resolvers validate with
 DNSSEC)
 2) dig to the authoritative resolvers to see if it is a network
 problem. Their addresses are 205.225.182.2, 134.186.254.247 and
 205.225.182.66. So:
 dig @205.225.182.2 SOA ca.gov
 By the way, there IS something wrong in net.ca.gov. Name resolution of
 the nameservers' names servfails. To quote DNSviz "DNSKEYs exist for
 algorithm(s) 8, 7 in the net.ca.gov zone, but the net.ca.gov/SOA RRset
 was not signed by any DNSKEY with algorithm(s) 7."

 It works for me under the guest account and my login. 
 I know they've recently had some scheduled maintenance.
 It cleared several minutes after sending that. Seems fine now.

 Down for me via Cogent since 8:40 am Central.  IPv4 access is just fine.
 IPv6 access from another host via NTT is fine, too, so I suspect a Cogent
 issue.

 Sorry for the noise, it was confirmed to be a not-yet-fully understood issue
 between our upstream provider and one of their providers.  Traceroutes now
 show it flowing over Sprint.

 Down for me via Cogent since 8:40 am Central.  IPv4 access is just fine.
 IPv6 access from another host via NTT is fine, too, so I suspect a Cogent

Zayo/360networks/Onvoy high packet loss & jitter
###############################################################
 We are seeing major issues with them, here is the update from their NOC:
 We are looking at this issue and it appears there is an issue out in Zayo
 Bandwidth causing degraded intermittent packet loss.  This issue has been
 escalated to the highest level within Zayo Bandwidth and Onvoy.  Once there
 is something found, we will be sure to pass it along.  Currently they are
 trying to isolate where the issue could possibly be.
 Zayo Bandwidth is currently working with their equipment vendor to try and
 Isolate this issue.
 Zayo Bandwidth has a tech on site and they are in the process of either
 rebooting or reseating a piece of equipment.  Again there is still no ETR.
 Once we have something more we will pass it along.

Twitter: mixed-mode security?
###############################################################
 I've been using HTTP anywhere (in Firefox), and whatever does that in Chrome,
 on both Linux and Windows, for some months or more.
 Suddenly tonight, I see that Chrome is complaining about mixed-mode security
 on Twitter -- but not on FB or any other sites I visit that way.
 Firefox isn't complaining about Twitter.
 Chrome is known to be pickier about this; a site I worked on had to test
 both cause Chrome would complain when FF did not.
 Can some other folks check Twitter over HTTPS/IPv4 tonight and see if they
 are also getting the slashed-out https indication on Twitter?
 Cheers,

 ----- Original Message -----
 Generally, anywhere I go on twitter's site (since it's AJAX now, there
 really isn't anywhere you "go"), it's https and it's not crossed out,
 as Chrome does to indicate mixed-mode.
 As of tonight, I'm getting the "crossed-out https" indicator everywhere,
 even after a cache purge and a Ctrl-F5 reload.
 Remind me where Chrome identifies what's unsecure, and I'll go look it up.
 Sure.  But this is "change in working environment, not apparently prompted
 by anything user-side".
 Cheers,

 Some evidence: I'm on Sprint (in Seattle), ported through Google
 Voice, and GV is not seeing them, so my friends aren't either! However
 I did receive some this morning from a friend on AT&T.

 Our NOC is also noting extended SMS delivery times for both ingress and

 We are still in the process of testing other carriers now.
 Initial observations point to an issue at Syniverse, however we are still

 This seems to be PRIMARILY between ATT and VZW.
 I have been able to duplicate the symptoms between those carriers in several
 different BTA's on both coasts. There seems to be some minor Sprint
 involvement but the bulk is ATT-> VZW and VZW-> ATT
 ATT-> ATT and VZW -> VZW seems unaffected

(Probably) weather-related outages in Toronto (incl. 151 Front)
###############################################################
 A customer has seen a power glitch and a cooling problem in a suite on the 4th floor at 151 Front.  At this time the devices are reporting falling sensor temperatures so cooling might be working now.
 Another service provider has reported that their connections to Chicago and Halifax are affected by power outages and/or flooding due to heavy rain seen this afternoon in southern Ontario.
 CP24 reports that there is "another cluster of thunderstorms" on the way.

 We took a brief hit on AC power in 602 (Cologix) but not on DC power.
 Temperatures rose rapidly but are now starting to cool slowly (chilled water
 running at 50% required output I've heard).
 Massive flooding in various parts of Toronto according to news coverage?.

google trouble?
###############################################################
 Seeing lots of reports of people unable to get to many Google services.
  Seems to be affecting Comcast users disproportionately.  It's fine for me,
 but a lot of my staff are basically out of luck...but according to the
 Google Apps Status page, everything is fine.
 It's anecdotal, but it would seem like there's an issue based on these
 reports.
 Oh, and this:
 http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/10/tech/web/google-down/index.html
 Anyone know what's up?  Fiber cut?  DC outages?

 Massive issues with a number of major sites, appears to be related to the
 google outage (as in unable to reach google analytics and as such the
 browser stalls, appearing as if the site the end user is attempting to
 reach is inaccessible).
 And yes, we can confirm an intermittent google outage across most major
 platforms in the southeast, except verizon wireless.

 I'm seeing browser stalls / hangs while trying to access
 ajax.googleapis.com on various websites.
 It looks as if google has succeeded in placing a single point of
 failure into a significant number of websites.

Sprint: "We don't need those servers over there, turn them off"
###############################################################
 Sprint is having a cell phone outage affecting the entire east coast,
 any phone which was EVER on the Nextel network, even if subsequently moved
 to Sprint years ago, calls not going through. 
 ETTR 1pm CST.
 Apparently Sprint shut down the servers which controlled the Nextel network,
 after shutting down the Nextel network itself two weeks ago, 
 not taking into consideration that turning off those Nextel servers would
 break the ability to use many Sprint phones.

 Sounds like someone didn't analyze what the servers actually did.

 FYI - got a call from a customer last night about a Xerox site unreachable
 through us.  Found the prefix coming from Cymru.  Instructed our NOC to
 work with them to resolve.  Cymru first claimed they were not sending it
 because it was not a bogon.  Once we proved it was coming from them, they
 woke somebody up at our request and found it listed as a 'bad route',
 whatever that means.  Their workaround was to shut down the peering to us.
 Anybody else use Cymru and have this issue?  Our 2 peering addresses
 are 38.229.66.20 and 193.231.140.82

 Now more of our sites are starting to fail as the local DNS cache begins to
 expire. This could be affecting everyone who uses NetSol for name
 resolution, or at least a large cross-section of their user base.

 ns10.worldnic.com has address 206.188.198.5
 traceroutes/mtrs to these destinations stop presumably at a border

 Hello all, has anyone else noticed that some of the Network Solutions name servers are unresponsive? Take this for example:
 AMERIGON.COM<http://AMERIGON.COM> has name server entries NS9.WORLDNIC.COM<http://NS9.WORLDNIC.COM> and NS10.WORLDNIC.COM...
 $ dig @ns9.worldnic.com<http://ns9.worldnic.com> amerigon.com<http://amerigon.com>

 We're seeing the same thing here, plus the NetSol website appears down.  Appears to be across multiple NS servers and not just 43/44.

 Now posted on their facebook site: ?Network Solutions is experiencing a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack that is impacting our customers as well as the Network Solutions site. Our technology team is working to mitigate the situation. Please check back for updates.?  I don?t have their earlier posting talking about yesterday?s issues.
 I also learned from a co-worker (who supports some small banks) about yesterday?s issues that ?It was an Islamic group.  It sounded like servers were compromised, which lead to the compromised web sites.?  He either learned this in a news article, or a banking-related security bulletin.

 Yes the site is down and some of the World NIC DNS servers
 I reported to outages.org site a while ago, guess they are napping

 Now more of our sites are starting to fail as the local DNS cache begins to expire. This could be affecting everyone who uses NetSol for name resolution, or at least a large cross-section of their user base.

 No, no, no. This paper is, despite its date, about a month-old *other*
 problem, documented in
 <http://blogs.cisco.com/security/hijacking-of-dns-records-from-network-solutions/>. Bad
 copy. As usual, do not believe eveything you read on the Web.
 NetSol name servers are unreachable here as well, and we're also seeing failures.

 Now more of our sites are starting to fail as the local DNS cache begins to expire. This could be affecting everyone who uses NetSol for name resolution, or at least a large cross-section of their user base.

 Hello all, has anyone else noticed that some of the Network Solutions name servers are unresponsive? Take this for example: 
 AMERIGON.COM has name server entries NS9.WORLDNIC.COM and NS10.WORLDNIC.COM... 
 $ dig @ ns9.worldnic.com amerigon.com 
 ; <<>> DiG 9.8.1-P1 <<>> @ ns9.worldnic.com amerigon.com

 We have seen it across many Network Solutions DNS servers clients are using.
 Specifically:
 ns10 and ns11
 ns31 and ns32
 ns53 and ns54
 ns97 and ns98
 I think there have been a few more, checking with staff, so wider spread than just a couple of their dns servers.

 Hmm, we have been having issues for the last 2 hours, took a while to point the issue towards cogent, and 5 minutes after I sent this email, the problem disappeared...

 Cogent has nearly constant peering issues with Alter.Net (Verizon)...although usually I see that in San Jose not NYC.

 Anyone seeing massive packet loss passing through cogent? Traceroutes appear to be okay, but we are getting a lot of vpn disconnects as well as lost ping packets when we traverse cogent.

SE Michigan: AT&T cell (3G and data) service downtime evening of July 19, 2013
###############################################################
 Multiple reports on Twitter suggest problems with the AT&T cell service (3G
 and data) across SE Michigan (Ann Arbor, Warren, Grand Blanc all reported
 in). The outage lasted about an hour (about 9p -10p ET) according to
 reports and service appears to be normal now.
 I don't have any inside info.

Comcast/Cogent Peering issue at 56 Marietta
###############################################################
 Anyone else seeing packet loss starting at the peering point for Comcast
 and Cogent at 56 Marietta Ga? Had someone mention it on IRC about seeing
 issues from Comcast customers. I ran a few MTR's to some of our customers
 and found one site in the Atlanta area that I could reproduce the issue.
 Others in the metro area were fine if they bypassed that data center/peers.
 like xo to Comcast was fine. On this location I don't have an actual device
 to do a reverse path on.

 On the phone with my client (&Att rep) and this is what the support rep told us. 
 With that said, an hour and half after I sent this their UVERSE service was up and running.

ATT DSL outage in 989 area code(Bay City, MI)
###############################################################
 Is anyone else seeing a DSL outage(sync no surf) for the past few days? We
 have 2 DSL lines that have been down for 3days 4 hours at this point. ATT
 keeps pushing the ETR back. Now they are telling us the ETR is 7/24/13 at
 4pm. Does anyone have any "inside" information of whats going on? We have 2
 dry loops that have sync but we can't authenticate. ATT did their normal
 song and dance of saying no outage for the first day and we had to dispatch
 a tech to find out the outage.
 Location is Bay City, MI
 Ticket # I provided for the outage is 2677-12440

P4: Facebook: XMPP chat: missing Real Name aliases
###############################################################
 I use XMPP and Pidgin to connect to FB chat, and tonight, for the 
 first time in my memory, some of my active users in the user list 
 are showing up (both in the list and in conversation panes) with 
 no "Real Name" alias; just -biglongdecimalnumber at chat.facebook.com.
 There doesn't seem to be any pattern; most users who are active show
 up as usual.
 It's flapped in and out several times; first spotted around 2233EDT.
 If anyone has a channel to Facebook Chat engineering, you might pass
 this along.
 Cheers,
 -- jra

 Well, my sister is on Mindspring/Earthlink rather than Road Runner, 
 but she's one hop past ten0-0-0-4.tamp09-ser2.bhn.net, and tracing to her
 modem from my VPS in Texas, I bet 0.0% loss and no appreciable jump in
 28ish ms times, so, "can you provide some more detail"? :-)

wiki.outages.org back online
###############################################################
 Hi -
 I apologize for the delay in getting wiki up/running in a timely manner. 
 At this time wiki.outages.org is up and functioning as expected. The 
 disk space had filled completely causing mysql to crash. We had to purge 
 old apache logs to get enough space to start MySQL safely.
 As of right now, there is 160+ gigs of spam entries from past year but 
 from our maintenance in January, we do not see that additional spam has 
 been posted.
 We will need to go through another round of maintenance so we can 
 proceed with spam removal.
 More as it develops.
 regards,
 /virendra

 unable to contact anybody at the site.  Is anybody out there listening that
 could shed some light on this?  We confirmed with the circuit provider that
 they can see their equipment.
 Thanks.

 Peering was just restored.  Apparently there was a facilities issue over
 the weekend.  The problem was compounded by staff that no longer works
 there and a failed phone system.  Thanks to all who responded with
 information and ideas on how to troubleshoot.
