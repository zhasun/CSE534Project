 Sprint technician informed us that there was a power outage in the Baltimore
 site on 11/28/06 between 2-3:00 PM EST.  During this outage, several our
 clients could access our network.  This incident re-occured again the next
 day between 1:45-4:15 PM.
 Does anyone have further info?

 Drew,
 There is definitely a power outage at telx/60 Hudson.  According to telx,
 this was a scheduled maintenance gone bad.  I have someone onsite and he is
 reporting that power should be restored shortly.
 Note, those with redundant feeds within the facility should only see a
 partial outage.

 Just some further info on this- 2 receivers, different mfg.,  40 miles
 away from each other had issues in the same 10 minute period.
 The alarm was "not enough satellites visible", but usually they both see
 a minimum of 8-11 birds , which is more than enough. So perhaps the
 solar flare was to blame.  It was not service affecting, since both have
 rubidium oscillators. Just scary since we had never rec'd the alarm
 before (with nightmarish  visions of network collapse :)
 Thanks all for the input. 
 In addition to that solar flare, there is also a mild geomagnetic
 storm in progress. With the solar flare, it was on the opposite side
 of the sun from that of earth. With x-rays being rather directional, I
 am thinking the solar flares may not be to blame.
 Anyways, cool space weather website:

 Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be high. Region 930

 further X-class activity.
 Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected to be
 unsettled to active on 07 - 08 December with a chance for periods of minor
 or major storm conditions due to the recurrent coronal hole high speed
 stream. Quiet to unsettled conditions are expected on 09 December. The
 greater than 10 MeV proton event is expected to continue for at least

 To us - this means expect disruptions with wireless systems (including
 cellular - ALL cell towers use GPS for clocking purposes)
 Geomagnetic Storm Warning
 14.12.2006 15:24 
 WARNING: Geomagnetic K-Index of 6 expected
 Issue Time: 2006 Dec 14 1404 UTC
 Valid From: 2006 Dec 14 1405 UTC
 Valid To: 2006 Dec 14 2359 UTC
 Warning Condition: Onset

 Magnetic storm approaching Earth
 14.12.2006 15:43 
 Russian weather scientists expect increase of geomagnetic activity and a
 very powerful magnetic storm to happen between December, 14 and 15.
 The third outburst was detected on the Sun, which resulted in the increase
 of wave absorption on the illuminated surface of our planet in a day or two,
 the research press release from the Institute of Earth's Magnetism said. The
 scientist said storm to be the strongest magnetic storm for the year 2006.
 The storm is predicted to be even stronger than the one detected in April.
 Radio communications, satellites and power grids could face potential
 interruptions or damage, however.

Abovenet fibre cut; Washington D.C.
###############################################################
 At around 09:57 PST, we saw heavy amounts of packet loss via our
 Abovenet connection via the Fort Worth/Dallas area.
 Abovenet IP group has stated that there's a fibre cut in the
 Washington D.C. area which is affecting their "southern route",
 and peering between Chicago<->DC, FTW/Dallas<->DC, and northern
 Virginia<->DC was affected.
 Reconvergence took place (for the west coast) in San Jose, going
 out of four OC48s destined to Chicago, but those became saturated.
 I don't have any other details, other than an RFO will be provided.

 I've gotten three statements -- one from their IP NOC via phone,

 a few minutes later an Email stating that a "networking event had

 Whoever I spoke to in their NOC was coherent and seemed to know
 a bit about what was going on and was very helpful.  So if there
 was not a fibre cut, I was simply told the wrong thing by Abovenet.

 We just lost visibility to sites in APAC for no less than 4 of our

 a lot.

 Not sure how many of you got impacted by quest outage.
 http://www.daily-times.com/ci_4926735
 Hopefully someday (wishful thinking) ISPs can be more proactive in
 reporting their planned & unplanned outages to public forum(s) such as
 outages mailing list <grin>. Similar to security advisory reporting
 which is now a standard practice.
