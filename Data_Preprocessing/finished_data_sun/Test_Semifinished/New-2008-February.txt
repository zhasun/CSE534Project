  "We had another cut today between Dubai and Muscat three hours back.
 The cable was about 80G capacity, it had telephone, Internet data,
 everything," one Flag official, who declined to be named, told Zawya
 Dow Jones.
 The cable, known as Falcon, delivers services to countries in the
 Mediterranean and Gulf region, he added.

 Hmmm. I thought I saw Osama putting on his diving suit... ***SHRUG*** :)
 Have there been any ETAs named yet for all three of these cable repairs?
 We have an office in India and it made me think, when these American
 companies decided to outsource to India, did any of them consider ANY
 of the telecom infrastructure over there? I don't want to come across
 as negative but our experiences with all the telecom providers over in
 India have been horrible! Echoey PSTN networks, extreme network
 congestion, etc...

 Dear All,
 Thought I?d give you all an update on where we (FLAG) are with the cable
 cuts ?
 FEA Segment D - The Cable ship CS Certamen is now expected to arrive at
 the Alexandria repair ground on Wednesday 6^th February. A Permit for
 the repair is currently being expedited with the Egyptian authorities.
 FEA Segment M - The cable ship CS Asean Restorer has been booked for
 this repair. It is currently out on an APCN repair and with current plan
 will be ready to start any work on our cable on or after 11th Feb. We
 have the OTDR traces from Penang and see that the fault is around 28km
 out from the station.
 FALCON Segment 7b (Bandra Abbas ? Al Seeb) - E-Marine continues to await
 the permit to enter the Iranian waters and current forecast for the ship
 to start a work is around 19^th February.
 FALCON Segment 2 - Fault 1^st February 41km from repeater, which is
 between the first two repeaters out of Dubai toward Muscat (Al Seeb).
 The ship has left Abu Dhabi and is on route to the repair ground. The
 repair is expected to start in the next 12 hours (weather permitting).
 FALCON Segment 7a - Fault 1^st February between BND (Bandar Abbas, Iran)
 and KWI (Kuwait), we are waiting for ship to go out and it maybe fixed
 before going out the fault on 7b ? to be confirmed.
 I hope this helps,

 Couldn't get to your voice mail at home or work Wednesday or Thursday -- or
 leave a message on some phones?
 Neither could any other California customers with voice mail on their
 Verizon Communications Inc. land lines.
 A database error in a central server in Ontario froze the software for all
 740,000 land-line customers subscribing to Verizon's voice mail early
 Wednesday, and the state's second-largest telephone company couldn't say
 late Thursday when the problem would be fixed.
 "Unfortunately, it's a huge file and it's taking a long time," said Verizon
 spokesman Jonathan Davies. "All our resources are deployed, and we'll have
 it back up as soon as possible."
 Most of Verizon's 3 million land-line customers are in Southern
 California's affluent beach communities and the Inland Empire. The outage
 did not affect Verizon Wireless customers.

 E-mail service of Research In Motion's BlackBerry smartphones experienced a
 "critical severity outage" on Monday, the company told clients in an
 e-mail.
 "This is an emergency notification regarding the current BlackBerry
 Infrastructure outage," RIM support account manager Bryan Simpson said in
 an e-mail. The message said the outage affected enterprise clients and
 "users of the Americas network."
 RIM was not immediately available for comment and its e-mail gave no
 estimate on when service may be restored or how many individuals could be
 affected.
 Last April, a massive outage crashed BlackBerry service across North
 America, leaving thousands of users without access to wireless e-mail.

 Hope you all get it back soon, I know what a pain it can be seeing your
 beautiful BB and not being able to use it *laugh*

Salesforce.com Suffers Outage
###############################################################
 -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

 Via eWeek.
 [snip]
 One of Salesforce.com's key North American CRM servers, NA5, was up and
 down for most of the business day Feb. 11 following a software upgrade, a
 Salesforce customer who asked to remain anonymous told eWEEK.
 The unstable server caused some havoc in an unspecified number of
 customers' accounts, the customer said.
 The software upgrade was installed over the weekend, but at 8:22 a.m.
 Pacific time, the company's internal server information Web page said, "NA5
 Service Degradation: The technology operations team has been made aware of
 intermittent service disruptions to NA5. Please check back for further
 updates."
 Salesforce.com, based in San Francisco, subsequently reported similar
 "service degradations" at 9:26 a.m., 10:19 a.m., 11:23 p.m. and 12:20 p.m.
 before announcing at 2:04 p.m. that "the Salesforce.com Technology team has
 restored the service issue with NA5 at 22:11 UTC. We apologize for any
 inconvenience this may have caused you."
 The tech op team did not specify exactly what the root cause of the problem
 was. That information may be posted by tomorrow, a Salesforce.com employee
 told eWEEK. The employee did not want his name used because he is not
 authorized to speak for the company.
 A Salesforce.com spokesperson has not returned calls from eWEEK at this
 time.

 Subject: Power Fun at 151 Front Street, Toronto
 Hi all,
 Today is Diesel Day at 151 Front Street, where the building owner shuts down 
 all grid power to allow intrusive power maintenance to happen, and the building 
 is fed by generator power only.
 At least one suite on the 6th floor has been affected by a generator failure, 
 so far.
 Just thought I'd pass on the news, in case there's anybody here who is 
 scratching their heads about equipment or sessions down in Toronto which seem 
 to have no rational cause. Most ISPs in the building (and the TorIX) have 
 engineers on-site; if you have equipment located there which needs some TLC and 
 you have no immediate/regular access to remote hands, let me know off-list and 
 I'll try to put you in touch with someone who has appropriate access: I'm not 
 on-site, but I have phone numbers for people who are.
 Joe

 Seeing issues with XO transit in Philly as well. Based on customer
 reports we received, it appears to be XO -> Qwest or vice versa that was
 most heavily affected. Traceroutes out died 1 hop into XO's network, and
 ingress traceroutes died within Qwest's network before even reaching XO.

 XO says all clear. Claims a core router failure as the cause, although
 the first guy I talked to said it was a DNS problem. Internetpluse.net
 shows XO looking normal again as well.
 Pondering bringing my XO transit back up. Anyone still seeing issues?

Widespread Power Outage Hits South Florida

 Via The Miami Herald.

 Power outages are cascading through many parts of South Florida, with
 Florida Power & Light and others reporting blackouts in portions of Miami,
 Doral, Westchester, Pembroke Pines, Miramar and Boca Raton.
 Many traffic lights are not working and nine accidents were reported in
 Miami-Dade County between 1:04 p.m. and 1:26 p.m. Police agencies were
 dispatching officers to as many intersections as possible.
 The lights flickered off at several South Florida hospitals, which had to
 switch to generator power.
 ''We had a blip here and the generators kicked in immediately,'' Jackson
 Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Lorraine Nelson said.
 Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach and Baptist Hospital in Southwest
 Miami-Dade reported similar situations.
 A spokeswoman for FPL said the company was investigating the extent and
 cause of the problem.

 Paul,
 You may want to relay to various lists that two nuclear reactors at Turkey
 Point (that's South of Miami) have been shut down. Reason given is
 precautionary measures.
 AP reported that there were fighter jets overhead, but that is NOT
 confirmed.
 At this time FPL reports that av. 4 million customers are affected.
 All schools are dismissed at this time. Expected time of restoration is up

 Contrary to news reports on CNN and AP there were NOT eight nor five

 The Crystal River reactor and St. Lucie twin reactors (fossil and gas) have

 =======
 Grid status:
 An apparent massive equipment failure at a Florida Power & Light substation
 in the Miami area triggered the two nuclear reactors at the company's Turkey
 Point to halt. The Fla Nuclear Commission confirmed this. The shut reactors
 caused sub grids 4,5, 6, 7 and 8 to drain power from up state and west
 state, as the Dade/Broward counties have a high demand. Restoration time
 update: between 06:00 and 07:00 PM near to normal operation is expected.
 There was indeed a squad off McDill in the air near the coastal plant, but
 that's a daily routine. There is NO reason to assume this has anything to do
 with the reactor closing.

Abovenet Routing Instability
###############################################################
 Had a bunch of calls come in from customers starting around 1:15 PM. Put in a call to Abovenet and was told they're experiencing a "global routing issue".  Also received an email from them around 8:10 AM EST today indicating that they had experienced an issue with their backbone but that it had been resolved. We've shut down our Abovenet transit and all customers are seeing normal availability again.
 Anybody got any additional info with regard to this?

 I have no details of the problem, but can confirm what you're seeing;
 Abovenet MPLS connectivity between Santa Clara and Virginia is severed
 as well.
 I also saw the notice Abovenet sent earlier this morning about the
 "backbone issue", though at that time we saw nothing.
