Intermittent Facebook problems in Southeast Asia?
###############################################################
 I'm currently seeing this intermittently from Facebook in Southeast Asia (it doesn't appear to be MITMed, the cert checks out):
 -----
 Sorry, something went wrong.
 We're working on getting this fixed as soon as we can.
 -----
 Is anyone else seeing similar issues with Facebook in Southeast Asia, or in any other region?

 Just an FYI, there is a Windstream fiber cut effecting Ohio and Kentucky customers, no ETA to repair based on their phone message.  Still on hold waiting to open case to find out more.

 Is anyone having issues with Any2 in LA? I have no evidence but I'm 
 hearing some things, if anyone could debunk.
 Thanks

 I guess it's nothing, I don't even remember, something about the network 
 having major congestion or some sort of attack.

Major outages today, not much info at this time
###############################################################
 I know this isn?t much help, but there are major problems with multiple ISPs since around 4-5 AM EST.  I really don?t have much detail, but I have sites that are unreachable from some providers.  Looks like Comcast, level3, ATT, cogent, etc.
 So, it?s probably not just you, but I?m afraid I don?t know who it is.  I heard one report of a datacenter outage.

 routes.

 I'm not so sure. None of my four upstreams is showing that many. Level3 (as an example) is 497,389 right now.
 This might be an issue for some places but probably isn't the full "this is why everyone is down today" explanation.

 I go with the fiber cut issue. And maybe the other bgp sessions are getting overloaded because thing have to re-route.

 AS 2381 definitely saw Level3 sending > 512K for a brief time this AM, 
 say 02:50 to 03:25.  Perhaps those affected haven't figured it out yet.

 Cisco gear can't support more than 512K routes... We hit that or close to that at around 4am EDT today.
 ISPs are scrambling to update memory in their routers.

 So is this issue all related to a fiber cut or a DC/Peering point having issues?

 Just an FYI, there is a Windstream fiber cut effecting Ohio and Kentucky customers, no ETA to repair based on their phone message.  Still on hold waiting to open case to find out more.

 "Update: One of our data centers went down, we have the service fully running on another data center & are working to minimize impact."
 I'm getting "An error occurred while attempting to contact the server. Please check your Internet connection." In my LastPass bar on Firefox.
 So, if you're getting errors with LastPass, this is why.

 I know this isn?t much help, but there are major problems with multiple ISPs since around 4-5 AM EST.  I really don?t have much detail, but I have sites that are unreachable from some providers.  Looks like Comcast, level3, ATT, cogent, etc.
 So, it?s probably not just you, but I?m afraid I don?t know who it is.  I heard one report of a datacenter outage.

 When did Windstream come back up after their big outage from the fiber
 cut?  AS7029 has a couple thousand routes.  Just a possible correlation I

 We were told by Quality Technology Services in Atlanta that they were "installing additional memory" to correct the issue.  Perhaps they meant they were actually reconfiguring/bouncing the routers.... I know they had Cisco engineers on site in GA, CA, and NJ today.
 Either way, after our network link went totally down and came back up, the issue was resolved.

 So is this issue all related to a fiber cut or a DC/Peering point having issues?

 Just an FYI, there is a Windstream fiber cut effecting Ohio and Kentucky customers, no ETA to repair based on their phone message.  Still on hold waiting to open case to find out more.

 "Update: One of our data centers went down, we have the service fully running on another data center & are working to minimize impact."
 I'm getting "An error occurred while attempting to contact the server. Please check your Internet connection." In my LastPass bar on Firefox.
 So, if you're getting errors with LastPass, this is why.

 I know this isn?t much help, but there are major problems with multiple ISPs since around 4-5 AM EST.  I really don?t have much detail, but I have sites that are unreachable from some providers.  Looks like Comcast, level3, ATT, cogent, etc.
 So, it?s probably not just you, but I?m afraid I don?t know who it is.  I heard one report of a datacenter outage.

 This increases the size of the TCAM allocated for v4 routes, at the
 cost of v6 space. This doesn't actually *solve* the issue, but does at
 least kick the can down the road a bit longer...
 TCAM based solutions for FIB, while cheap to implement, leads to pain...

 Looks like "full route" routing tables peaked at ~515k routes briefly
 due to an aggregation issue at Verizon. We saw the increase in several
 of our full table feeds from Level3 today.

 Caron,  this might have been because you are still connected to one of the older GC 7609 aggregation switches and it couldn't handle the full RIB table for the Internet routes.  Most of those 7609's should have been replaced, you should contact Level 3 and ask when you are getting moved to the new Aggregation switches?

 Joe Sanchez

 The sup2t-xl for the 6500 series should not affected by this. The 1M TCAM space is shared and not default configured for 512k.

 That's a tcam limit on the 6500/7600 platform. It's not upgradable, but it is configurable.?
 The gsr platform doesn't have a hard limit like this, its just memory (And is upgradeable), but most with that gear will have already had to upgrade well before now.?

 I don't see anything at the moment. I see reports of a phone issue in one
 area and a problem with a couple of video channels elsewhere, but I have
 not heard of anything widespread. Do you have any more details?
 Thanks,

 Scratch that. I did find an ongoing issue with some optical transport
 affecting WI. I'm sure that's it. Possible flaky card. Sounds like they
 reseated it and these issues resolved.

ATL [55 Marietta] Power Issue - FireDept on-site
###############################################################
 My understanding is that power in select portions of 55 Marietta has been
 severed by automated fire-protection equipment and the fire-department as
 of roughly 4PM eastern.
 All of our primary and secondary services are currently out on the 5th, 6th
 and 18th floor.
 Anyone else have any additional information they may be able to provide by
 chance? We have staff on-site and have been told by the fire-department
 that we cannot enter the building itself until the site has been cleared.

IPv6 HE tunnel BGP down ???
###############################################################
 My BGP session to HE for IPv6 has bounced twice in the last few minutes. It's been stable for years, so something is going on.
 Traceroutes to the IPv4 tunnel destination get from lightpath to HE, but appear to get lost in HE.
 Anyone know what's going on?

 Exactly one endpoint (tserv7.ash1 at Ashburn, VA, US) is shown as "down"
 on https://www.tunnelbroker.net/status.php now.
 How do your traces over the tunnel compare to similar traces via
 http://lg.he.net ?
 Jitter aside, mine is solid in Dallas (at least to/fro' Google)...

 Haven't seen my message echo back to list yet, so bcc'ing OP.
 Should clarify, here this is just a tunnel, no BGP.
 Also the Ashburn node previously shown as 'down' is now shown as 'up' as
 the entire tunnelbroker universe.

 More info, such as the IPv4 and IPv6 traceroutes you 
 speak of, would be helpful.

Microsoft/XBoxlive issue
###############################################################
 We are seeing a return routing issue from Microsoft sites (all of them; xboxlive, microsoft.com, etc)
 These are the only sites we're currently having reachability issues with.  We're uplinked to Level3, Centurylink, NTT and Cogent out of NYC, Boston, etc. 
 If I traceroute to 134.170.188.221, I die 1-2 hops in each carrier.  I'm assuming this is a return path traffic issue as I have good BGP routes to Microsoft sites.  So far, we're only seeing this to Microsoft and no others.  It's confirmed that we can access these sites from off of our network.
 If anyone from MS/Xboxlive monitors this list, can you contact me off-list please?
 For everyone else, if you could copy/paste me a traceroute to 64.246.132.194 (offlist) that would be great.
 TIA

 I'm not seeing any problems with connecting to outlook.com/lync, and no 
 noticeable issues with using O365. Seems that Microsoft and the Xbox 
 Live website are fine on my end as well.
 I'm in Richardson, TX, using TWCable.

pac-west outages
###############################################################
 anyone else experiencing DID issues with pac-west? calls either are 
 answerable or not since possibly before 7AM, from what i'm being told, 
 they're having media issues and there is no ETA.
 the last pacwest outage was just a few months ago when one wilshire did 
 a power test and their router didn't return.. for 15 or so hours.

SF Bay area XO Communications fiber cut?
###############################################################
 FYI-
 Internap just informed us that their is a fiber cut in the SFO002 area affecting XO (one of their peering partners).
 We're not seeing any issues from it other than a brief route flap when it happened.
