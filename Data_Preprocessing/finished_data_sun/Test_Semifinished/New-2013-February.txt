Office365 (Microsoft-hosted email/lync/etc) down
###############################################################
 Office365 (Microsoft's hosted email, sharepoint, Lync, etc service) seems 
 to be broken for new connections.. IE - users who had Outlook open or an 
 established Lync connection before it bombed are still working fine, but 
 people trying to connect are getting failures.
 I am not sure, but it may be a DNS issue? IE - the server that my mailbox 
 resides on (BY2PRD0712.mailbox.outlook.com) does not resolve.
 Looks to be widespread:
 http://community.office365.com/en-us/forums/160/t/83411.aspx
 We have a customer on that service and a co-worker found a status page (requires login, otherwise I'd ask him for the URL) indicating that the signon service is having issues.

 As others have noted, O365 seems to be back to normal now. The status page 
 at O365 (requires login as you said) still has not cleared though.

 I'm getting reports from my techs that calls are not completing from Comcast to 734 numbers hosted with Bandwidth. Bandwidth is not seeing the calls make it to them. Does anyone know of any issues going on in that area?

 Interesting timing.
 A friend of mine who has her site hosted at a provider called "Just
 Host" also just asked if I could reach her stuff (I can't).  Her IP is
 within 173.254.0.0/17.

 Notice the common trend?
 199.58.199.114 is part of 199.58.196.0/22 which is "Ace Data Centers".
 Possibilities as I see them:
 a) This "Ace Data Centers" co-location provider (in Provo, UT) is
 experiencing network-level problems
 b) There is a "common hosting provider" who uses "Ace Data Centers" who
 is down hard and hasn't bothered to tell anyone what is going on.  If
 that's the case, time to read your contract and see if there's an SLA.
 TL;DR -- it's not you.

 lmao, i'm on my way out with hostmonster anyways, its too pricy for the
 little bit of hosting I do(2 sites) already moved one domain away from them
 and got my self a 2GB VPS for $70/year vs. the ~$130/year host monster
 wanted. plus I can do what ever I want on my VPS. just my 2 cents.
 I was actually planning on doing some of the actual migration tonight(I'm
 used to 3rd shift) i guess this thows a wrench in the works.

 Anyone  having SIP call quality problems with Windstream? It seems to be from about 10AM CST to 2PM CST for the past 3 to 4 days.  They are claiming a congestion issue in the northeast.

ATT Mircocell

 Hello,
 Since Sunday my ATT Microcell has been offline...   According to ATT CS 
 they say that the all of the northeast Microcell system is offline.   
 Something about a software upgrade to the Microcell's when banana's .
 Has anyone in the northeast heard anything similar or know anything?

 ATT Microcell's aggravate me. You would think they would want the world to install as many of these things they can, helping make their coverage ubiquitous. Instead, you have a unit which requires sky view (GPS), so that makes it damn near impossible to use in a basement (where many people don't have good cell coverage), and you have to pre-register the phones that will use it - with a limitation on it of how many phones are allowed to be pre-registered.
 This goes along with a whole list of complaints I have about cell carriers, who seem to have stalled in technology acceptance. Why no cell-voice or SMS or MMS over WiFi? I know a carrier or two are doing this, but it is not widely deployed. If they are complaining so much about network and frequency congestion, it seems that this sort of offload would be something they want.

 T-Mobile offers voice, SMS, and MMS over WiFi on most of its devices and
 has for the last several years.  This feature alone is a great reason to
 make a change and one reason I was so fearful of AT&T buying them up last
 year.

at&t text messaging
###############################################################
 Hi all,
 I'm seeing an inability for at&t phone to receive text messages.
 Sending to Verizon phones seems to work, but at&t to at&t, or Verizon
 to at&t does not.
 Twitter seems to have some chatter about this over the past 2hrs, so
 I'm wondering if others are seeing this nationally.
 Thanks,
 Mike

 It is, indeed.  Perhaps the list should set reply-to over to discuss?  This has benefits and drawbacks; I will discuss it with Vi and Frank.

 It should be but it seems to have descended into website outage, dns blips
 and localised cable provider reporting lately.
 Perhaps time for a new list with less noise?
 "The primary goal of this mailing list ("outages") is for outages-reporting
 that would apply to failures of major communications infrastructure
 components having significant traffic-carrying capacity, similar to what
 FCC provided prior to 9/11 days but they seem to have pulled back due to
 terrorism concerns. Some also believe that LEC's and IXC's also like this
 model as they no longer have to air their dirty laundry. Then again, this
 mailing list is not about making anyone look bad, its all about information
 sharing and keeping network operators & end users abreast on the situation
 as close to real-time information as possible in order to assess and
 respond to major outage such as routing voice/data via different carriers
 which may directly or indirectly impact us and our customers. A reliable
 communications network is essential in times of crisis. "

 Or a stronger definition of "major?"  I recently started a discussion on a
 state-wide Cox outage.  That seems major to me, but I really don't know if
 that's within the list terms.  Many times people post up that their one
 home internet connection is down, which clearly is outside the scope.  Some
 better definition and enforcement of such may help.
 There was a discussion on whether Facebook is a major part of
 "infrastructure" some time ago.  As much as most of us would like to say
 it's not, the reality is that to many end users it is the internet or the
 e-mail system.  Does this list apply to that?
 I'm subscribed here so I can learn of things that will affect our
 customers, and therefore us.  We are a VoIP hosted service company with
 customers globally, to IP and PSTN outages everywhere affect us.

 Based on this: "failures of major communications infrastructure components

 I would say this is backbone fibre outages only, sea cable cuts, full
 regional affecting issues etc.
 Websites and DNS belongs to NANOG.. or downforeveryoneorjustme.com
 Put another way, I can work out myself if there is a facebook or google
 outage and dont need to compare reports from 100 areas of the world none of
 which factor in the technology which distributed applications and sites use.
 What I think the above defines is clear "cable X is cut on bridge Y between
 cities A and B affecting providers L+M who both use this duct" type of
 notifications - things that are precise and fundamental in their nature.
 Exactly, and they will be continual and high volume in nature.. you will
 only gain real value in knowing of large infrastructure problems which
 affect many things simultaneously.

 I'd agree.  The problem is, when it's YOUR connection that's down, it's major.  When it's someone you never speak to, it doesn't matter at all.  Between those two extremes, it's all "shades of gray."
 I'd argue yes; the reason I cared a whit about Facebook isn't because I have end-users who use it, but that my employer offers OAuth via Facebook Connect.  When THAT goes down, it affects all manner of things.

 No, it qualifies given that almost every consumer (and a fair few business) facing service out there lets you use either Twitter or Facebook to authenticate; it's in the same bucket as 8.8.8.8 going down.  Widespread service failures for end users result if it happens, and is the kind of thing that's useful to understand in the context of "why is the helpdesk phone exploding."
 Localized only insofar as it's a layer 7 problem should it hit; past that, the effects are internet-wide.

 Its also clear from the recent posts that the details of how operators like
 Facebook and Google architect their applications is not well understood by
 its users.
 Hence we have issues reported which result in large threads which end up
 being of little use to anyone, even the users of those apps.

 This is definitely not encompassing Layer-7. I understand its important to

 users can discuss those issues.

 Fair rejoinder.
 Allow me to rephrase: I think it is important to a significant fraction of the 'Net when something that is used by a significant fraction of the 'Net goes down.  The examples above are usually more relevant to more people than a single fiber cut.
 And I gave you reasons why the above fits that description, which you conveniently snipped.
 However, you may be right.  Or you may well be on the wrong list.  Or maybe the definition needs massaging.
 Shall we define things like "infrastructure" better?  I would call the Domain Name System "communications infrastructure".  As a trivial (and hyperbolic) example, would you argue all 13 root servers going down should not be on topic?
 Shall we modify the part about "traffic-carrying capacity"?  Fewer Mbps are transmitted on one of the many fiber paths between Sprint & UUNET (which are typically redundant) than Netflix pushes.  However, Netflix doesn't "carry" any traffic.  Are you going to argue Netflix is not relevant to the readers of this list?  Many (most?) see a larger traffic shift from a Netflix outage than a cut between Sprint & UU.
 Then there is the fun around the word "major".  It could go on for weeks!
 But let's short-circuit this entertainment and ask a more basic question: Who defines these things, and by what process?  If this list is only for fiber cuts & router crashes, then let's say so and be done with it.

 Distributed applications fail and go down systemically,  sometimes

 Such reports have some potential importance; assuming appropriate
 effort was undertaken to confirm.
 I can't really comment on the long threads, as they were too long, so
 I didn't read them.
 I don't see exactly a flood of noise here, however.
 It's probably not unreasonable to suggest ignoring threads with
 'Facebook'  in the subject line;   if you don't believe it counts as
 significant traffic capacity,  or whichever $criteria_of_the_day  you

 the status quo of what was originally said.
 However, you may be right.  Or you may well be on the wrong list.  Or maybe
 Correct. And that avoids mandate creep and unnecessary discussion to define
 it - eg are the GTLDs important, what about google.com, what about the .biz
 or .cd ?
 I'd argue its important for many but off-topic. And this kind of website
 discussion exists simultaneously in many *NOG mailing lists, usually
 looping around the first 50 people saying who sees the service up and who
 sees it down, followed by 50 posts speculating on the cause of the issue,
 followed by 50 posts discussions the merits of GSLB vs anycast etc.
 I don't have the desire to argue for weeks, replying this morning is
 pushing it..
 But let's short-circuit this entertainment and ask a more basic question:
 Someone defined it, wrote it down and I'll run with it. In my understanding
 that means physical infrastructure failures of a significant nature, links
 carrying high capacity, multiple public network operators ... I'd have no
 issue making the wording more specific, but I think less specific is
 opening pandora's box.

 Feel free to redirict to -discuss if this is more appropriate there.
 I think making the definition of "major" more clear would be useful.  Despite Steve's comment about DNS, I think outages of 8.8.8.8 or OpenDNS count as major.  I think state-wide broadband outages also qualifies.
 Perhaps put a number of users affected?  Perhaps add an exception for geographical areas, say a whole country or province/state?
 Then when people email the list about a traceroute and having 20% packet loss on hop 5 out of 12 and nothing anything else, we can make fun of them.  You know, since that always works.
 Oh, I almost forgot: Jay, you're ugly and your mother dresses you funny.  (That should stop him from off-topic posting. :)

 And a cut between L3 & Sprint, or NYC & LON, which you seem to think qualify, is still "local" and "may in turn be only a small % of the wider telecom/internet user base".
 Aren't definitions fun?
 Oh, please, the details of how Operators like L3 & COLT operate their fiber infrastructure is not understood by L3 & COLT!
 I think the S:N ratio is orthogonal to whether it is FB, DNS, or fiber.
 Assume Akamai has an outage (using an intentionally impossible scenario just to prove a point :).  Would that be "communications infrastructure"?  Akamai has essentially zero fiber.  How about "significant traffic-carrying capacity"?  Akamai has no network.  Is it useful to the outages community?
 I would argue that "communications infrastructure" can easily encompass more than routers, DWDM, and fiber.  I would also argue that things which direct enormous amounts of traffic (FB, Netflix, Google, iPlayer, etc.) count, even though they do not actually _carry_ any traffic.
 This list isn't for discussion, we have -discuss for that.  (And I wonder if this thread should be there?)
 This list is for notification.  And I would like to be notified if 8.8.8.8 or Netflix is down.
 The list owners (or a vote of the members? I don't know how this works) can decide otherwise.  But your arguments are unpersuasive.
 OTOH: I don't like seeing long threads of useless info (e.g. "Is FB down?  I can't load it." with no other info) any more than the next guy.  But I repeat, that's orthogonal to the thing which is down.  We see just as many clueless "fiber cut" notices as "google is down" notices, if not more.

 Precisely. Although when the discussion about the stupid Facebook joke greatly exceeds the annoyance caused by the joke it seems even sillier. Can we just resume SOP and cut the chatter?

ADMIN: Code of Conduct

 Hi,
 A reminder to all list members that:
 The OUTAGES list has over several thousand subscribers so it is very 
 easy for a
 thread to have scores of posts while being off-topic and only of 
 interest to only a small proportion of subscribers. Please consider 
 before each post if your email will be of interest to the majority of 
 members or might alternatively be emailed directly the people of 
 interest or posted to another forum.
 I have reached out to certain individuals requesting to end this kabuki. 
 I would urge to the people on this list to use their good sense kindly 
 abide by the AUP.
 If you are so insistence of making your voice heard that is unrelated to 
 outages I urge you to a non-outages mailing list. If it is post outages 
 related, please use 'outages-discussion' list. Kindly avoid FLAME throwing.
 Please don't make us ban people or turn on moderation because for the 
 most part the list is working just fine, it makes work for us and takes 
 away from our work/family time.
 Please read the FAQ and AUP policy before posting for more details at, 
 http://wiki.outages.org/index.php/Code_of_Conduct
 You may direct feedback to me personally.
 regards,

Windstream outage due to fire in Chicago?

 We have T1 circuits (from XO) in Chicago that have been down since around
 06:30am CT on February 11th. Just learned that the LEC (Windstream/Paetec)
 is claiming this is a "widespread" outage related to their Cable network,
 precipitated by a facility fire. The rub is that Windstream refuses to
 provide an ETA or master ticket number. ;-(
 Anyone with a direct Windstream relationship have details? Perhaps an ETA?

 Good Evening,
 Any other carrier seeing intermittent issues with AS209 at a national level? We maintain QW/CTL IP transit circuits in just about every state, with the appearance of all sites affected, from multiple external (off-net) monitoring facilities.
 We noticed all former Qwest and current CenturyLink IP transit circuits bounced from 10:53:51 through until 11:03:47 and have noticed intermittent packet-loss since.

 Multi-homed AS209 customer here.  Century-Link just flapped 400,000 prefixes to us.  This is the second time in as many days.

 It _is_ working for us in Milwaukee, WI on Time Warner Cable. OpenDNS is
 anycast so I haven't dug that deep into it but it's working for us.
 FYI: traceroute with ICMP ping only works with OpenDNS, thus the -I option.

 Traceroutes appear to be broken due to policy (ACL) on their end, but I'm 
 able to send queries to and receive answers from 208.67.222.222 and 
 208.67.220.220.  My currently prefered path to them is Level3.

 Hi Josh, list,
 We had a packet-loss problem with one of our carriers in Ashburn this
 morning. This problem should be resolved now.
 Also see: http://system.opendns.com/
 Should you still experience connectivity issues please contact us off
 list at noc at opendns
 Cheers,
  Andree  (OpenDNS)

Vitelity outages
###############################################################
 Does anyone here use Vitelity?  They appear to be down (again), completely unreachable by phone or website and our entire phone system is down as well.  This seems to be happening on a regular basis, just wondering if anyone else uses them or has any information about what's going on.
 Thanks

 Yes - we are seeing packet loss to some of the inbound Vitelity servers,
 and are getting reports from clients of either no call availability or
 poor call quality

 I see their main web site is not coming up fully but if you log directly
 into their portal at https://portal.vitelity.net/login.php it seems to work
 fine.  I tested a handful of my numbers with them and they all seem to be
 up and in service.  In my experience they have been a reliable carrier for
 the past two years or so.

 We use them lightly, and had trouble reported on one 310-area number about

Level3 - 111 8th Ave, NYC

 At approx. 1:57pm EST we lost both our peering sessions with Level3. At
 2:00pm EST we lost physical connectivity to them.
 Just got off the phone with them and they confirmed the router we peer with
 is hard-down .
 Anyone else affected by this? Our ticket # is 6336015..

 Confirmed.  We have a 10GE hard down at approximately the same time.  According to Level3 the whole router died and they are replacing it.  How does that happen?  Did someone take a sledge hammer to it?

Paetec/Windstream outage in Michigan and Ohio
###############################################################
 Calls toward our VTN's in the greater Columbus, OH region have been failing since around 12pm EST. The triage guy who answered their enterprise support line said that at least 10 of their DS3's with various ILEC's in the area are down, and it is causing major outages in the Michigan/Ohio area. He wasn't sure if it was a fiber cut or an equipment problem, and didn't have an ETA.

 Paetec/Windstream outage in Michigan and Ohio
###############################################################
 In reference to Alex Forster -- From our Windstream account manager, there's two "impairments" affecting their network; one in South Bend, IN, on the US Signal Network plus up to two fiber cuts in the Columbus, OH, area.  Our WS service has been out since just prior to lunch.  We do some work with some offices using Time Warner fibre and AT&T and those are still up.  I'm told this is causing issues in Indiana (northern?), Columbus & Cleveland, OH, and Wheeling, WV, and now, per Alex, also in Michigan.

 having some issue there as we're not receiving inbound calls and going to a
 reorder.  Anyone have any information on this?
