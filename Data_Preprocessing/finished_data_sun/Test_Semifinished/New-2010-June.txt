Problems Getting to Successwareasp.com
###############################################################
  I have a couple customers trying to get to
 http://login.successwareasp.com/. I can do a traceroute all the way to
 the customers network then it drops off.
 I can get to it via my phone (T-Mobile) and a co-workers phone (AT&T),
 but not our network. It gets to the initial page that tries to
 redirect you, but the redirect never happens. I've tried in multiple
 browsers as well.
 Ping times earlier today were steady around 100ms, but now have
 leveled off at around 60ms.
 Just wanted to see if anyone else is having issues with this
 particular site or network?

 General Information

 About Outages & Mission statement:
 http://wiki.outages.org/index.php/Main_Page
 Credits:
 Credit goes to the Debian / NANOG mailing list for FAQ, which served as
 a model for the OUTAGES FAQ.
 Outages lists and AUP:
 ==========================================
 Mailing List Charter
 The OUTAGES mailing list is established to provide a forum for the
 exchange of major outages discussion of Critical Internet
 infrastructure, such as IXPs, DNS root servers, major carrier failures,
 major data center, carrier hotel, COs, etc., that require cooperation
 among network service providers, carriers and network operators around
 the globe. In order to continue to provide a useful forum for discussion
 of relevant outages issues, the list is governed by the following
 guidelines:
 Acceptable Use Policy (Code of Conduct)
 1. Discussion will focus on Internet / backbone related outages and
 technical issues surrounding it as described in the charter of OUTAGES.
 2. Postings of issues inconsistent with the charter are prohibited.
 3. Cross posting is prohibited.
 4. Do not quote messages that were sent to you by other people in
 private mail, unless agreed beforehand.
 5. Postings that include foul language, character assassination, and
 lack of respect for other participants are prohibited.
 6. Product marketing is prohibited.
 7. Postings of political, philosophical, religious and legal nature are
 prohibited.
 8. Using list as source for private marketing initiatives is prohibited.
 9. Autoresponders sending "out of office" or "vacation" mail either to
 the list or to the poster are prohibited.
 10. Try not to  flame; it is not polite.
 11. Never send your messages in HTML; use plain text instead.
 12. Do not send "test" messages to determine whether your mail client is
 working.
 Individuals who violate these guidelines will be contacted and asked to
 adhere to the guidelines.
 If groups of individuals persist in introducing topics that are outside
 the charter of OUTAGES, the moderator committee will send a request to
 the entire mailing list requesting adherence to the guidelines.
 OUTAGES List FAQ:
 ===================================================
 FAQ contributions are welcome -- please send email to admins at outages.org
 About OUTAGES and the List
 The primary goal of outages mailing list is for outages-reporting that
 would apply to failures of major communications infrastructure
 components having significant traffic-carrying capacity.
 See the main OUTAGES web page at:
 http://www.outages.org
 The OUTAGES Volunteer Committee is made up of network operator community
 members. You can reach the committee at admins at outages.org
 Is the list moderated?
 No, the outages mailing list is not moderated.
 I am not getting any mail anymore from the list! Is it down or what?
 * If for any reason your email address is unavailable, after some
 retries you will be automatically unsubscribed.
 * You may get unsubscribed because MTAs relaying traffic to you get
 bounces for some reason.
 * There are no major outages to report :-)

 Since early Tuesday morning, we have been suffering with the same issues 
 attempting to connect VPNs between hosts on Verizon FIOS Business class

 from other FIOS users, both residential and business, in the Tampa Bay 
 region.
 I'm also seeing noticeably slower throughput between our Road Runner and 
 FIOS endpoints.  The path outbound from Tampa Road Runner toward Verizon is 
 via Level3 in Atlanta.  (return path is via RR's tbone network through DFW)
 VPN connections hang and never fully connect.  FTP sessions are dying 
 mid-session, DNS queries randomly fail to complete, and other badness.
 It's bad enough we've had to statically route VPN and FTP traffic through 
 another provider to the destinations we need to hit.

 As I mentioned in a separate thread, we are seeing frequent problems when
 attempting to connect VPN endpoints on Verizon FIOS and hosts on Level3.
 Traceroutes show we're reaching those hosts by VZ/UUnet ---> Level3 in
 Atlanta.   VPN connections are mostly dying before the connection is fully
 negotiated.  FTP sessions are also dying-- some never get fully logged in,
 while others are dying mid-transfer.  We're also seeing DNS queries fail to
 complete.
 I am not 100% sure it's limited only to peering between VZ/UUnet and Level3,
 but that's the situation we're having the most problems with at this point.
 This has been going on since at least 5:00 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday.

 Interestingly, AT&T is having voice and data problems around LAX (Los

 It appears to be localized to the area and better once away from the

 This also is affecting any users who use email forms from quickbooks.  I spent about 30 minutes trying to troubleshoot this with a client this morning until I got this email...

 Subject: [VoiceOps] CenturyLink Outage
 We seem to be experiencing an outage with CenturyLink in the 308 area
 code, seeing backup DSL as well as T1 circuits all down.  Trying to
 call their NOC and we just get a fast busy.  Curious if anyone else is
 seeing issues with CenturyLink right now.
 Thanks,

verizon.net having SMTP issues?
###############################################################
 Verizon.net seems to be having SMTP issues.  Our e-mail queue is backing up
 for that domain, and manual connections close by themselves without a SMTP
 banner.
 Verizon's site
 https://www.verizon.net/central/vzc.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=vzc_help_sy
 stemStatus&status_type=Mail
 doesn't indicate any issue.

 Anyone else seeing suddenlink.net e-mail issues?  Our outbound queue is
 backing up to them and when I manually connect to port 25 the connection
 drops.

 You're probably looking for mx.suddenlink.net, but 25 is being refused
 there. An ISP that size with only one MX record? Ouch.
