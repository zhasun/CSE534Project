Anyone else seeing 100% connection failures over the last few minutes to

FWIW, it seems to be coming back (at least for me) now.  Am sending this

I have been able to access it without any problems using IMAP the entire
time, though.

Anyone else seeing 100% connection failures over the last few minutes to
gmail.com servers? I can ping them fine - but fail connections via web-mail,

Is anyone having issues making calls into Southern NH?  For example
603-882? Getting a lot of intermittent fast busy signals dialing out on
multiple carriers.

Hi sourcing from Comcast Business I am seeing intermittent latency issues going to Qwest as well as to HE services.  I'm not seeing anything huge other than that.  Http://internetpulse.net is showing some minor latency issues as well from multiple carriers (Sprint, Verizon, Internap, NTT).  Anyone aware of anything that might be behind these issues?

And that's just one of the many links listed on the wiki that's the companion
to this mailing list; specifically, it's on our Dashboard page:

  http://www.outages.org/index.php/Dashboard

You might find it useful to bookmark on your Firefox toolbar (Firefox
penetration on *this* list is 100%, right :-) for circumstances like this.

I'm always accepting contributions of new cool links for that page as well;
stick 'em on the discussion page.

Yes, they do have an outage.

Master Ticket NIL3901265

Words from our Q Rep:

We do have a master ticket opened NIL3901265.  This is Network wide and 
currently being worked on, unfortunately at this point we do not have an 
ETA.  Do you have access to Q-control?  An individual ticket can be 
opened thru Q-control.

Thanks,

Seeing issues in Qwest LA too starting around 6 AM PDT. Been on hold with Qwest support for a while--no one picking up, never a good sign...

Getting a recording that your call cannot be completed as dialed for all
calls?  No info from their NOC -

I'm getting failed lookups using google search from Louisville (insight communications).  "can't open the page because the server unexpectedly dropped the connection.".  Wondering if this is local or widespread.

Master Ticket NIL3901265

Words from our Q Rep:

We do have a master ticket opened NIL3901265.  This is Network wide and currently being worked on, unfortunately at this point we do not have an ETA.  Do you have access to Q-control?  An individual ticket can be opened thru Q-control.

Thanks,

I haven't heard the final reason(s) on why.

I do know a Qwest engineer called one of my end users stating they had a 
'couple T1's throwing 1000's of errors' and they removed those from 
service and things started working.

Nothing official, yet.

Interesting..
If those were SS7 links in the right place, I could see some issues there..
BUT you think they would have error reporting on that...


This is sounding more and more interesting...

Thanks Steve...

I've yet to see any of the major telco providers in the United States
actively monitor counters on any of their equipment (regardless of
capacity).  The modus operandi is "monitor nothing and wait until
customers complain".

I imagine Qwest operates similarly.

Hey all,

Anyone in the Las Vegas area notice a BGP outage with Integra Telecom within the last 20 minutes?  We lost all routes from them at two different locations in Vegas. 

I have a ticket open with their NOC but wanted to see if other saw it.

Sorry for the disruption.  A router was the victim of a DOS attack and it did cause BGP session resets.  Steps have been taken to prevent this result.

I'm curious: in this sort of situation, exactly what do networking
engineers do about this situation?

Let me clarify my question: as a system administrator, when I'm told
someone is DoS/DDoS'ing something, I immediately react in two ways: 1)
mitigate impact, and 2) find out why said attack happened.

Working for ISPs the majority of my life has taught me that most of the
time Netizens don't decide to DoS something without reason, no matter
how trivial or childish that reason is.  Maybe there's a user who's on
IRC causing trouble, maybe someone hosts a web forum that had some
remarks someone didn't like, or maybe there's an account which got
compromised and it's up to something suspicious.  Childish, petty, but
reality.

Do networking engineers do analysis of these scenarios in attempt to
ensure the situation doesn't recur, or do the efforts stop at "we put up
some filters, time for lunch"?

As a sysadmin, I suspect you're a little closer to the 'end' of the 
path, while netadmins (especially SP netadmins) are more in the middle. 
  I have a customer who's just a magnet for DoS attacks, based on a 
bunch of history/legacy of ownership and the like.

For me/us, we (attempt to) do two things: deflect the attack away from 
the victim (allowing the rest of the customer's network to come up for 
air), then (if possible) deflect the source of the attack.  If the 
attack continues longer and/or stronger, we contact upstreams to request 
investigation and/or deflection upstream.

Given the very rare success of finding ANYTHING out, there's rarely 
motivation to do much other than filter things.

Just wondering but the attack you guys were seeing was it a "normal" DOS attack or was it the DOS attack Cisco announced about IOS on Tuesday?

12:21 pm eastern. They said it was part of a larger outage, but then
called back to say that had been resolved. But things are still down.

Outage started at 11:37pm Pacific, give or take a minute.

I spoke to them at about 11:43pm and they were aware there was an issue, but
didn't know the cause.  Since then it's been impossible to get through to
anything but voicemail :(

One of my coworkers got through on the phone to their NOC after
several tries, about 20 min ago now I think, but they didn't give more
specifics as to cause.  I think they're just very busy, not that their
phones went out too.

This should probably go to outages-discuss, but I have to say something.

These kinds of outages were regular occurrences at HE Fremont (FMT2 had
not been built yet, but I doubt it matters).  Here's a few choice
examples -- and these are just a few -- of recurring things which never
got addressed.

I will never forget how packets with a Comcast source, HE Fremont
destination, went through an AT&T "device" somewhere in the mix which
would regularly burp/flake out and HE couldn't do anything about it.  No
alternate routes were propagated, so literally Comcast->HE was hard
down.  Single point of failure.

I will never forget how packets with a SBC DSL (now AT&T) source, HE
Fremont destination, went through Telia (a Swedish ISP with no North
American NOC) for a single hop, and that Telia would drop their BGP
session or severe their link for whatever reason.  Like the above, no
alternate routes were propagated, so literally SBC->HE was hard down.
Likewise, individuals in Sweden who used Telia also saw the same thing
going from Telia Sweden->HE Fremont.  Single point of failure.

I will never forget the Cisco router which would reboot every 4-5 months
for no reason... a problem which went on for literally years, and all I
was ever told was "well it's back up now" and "we have a case open with
Cisco".  Single point of failure.

I will never forget how HE refused to use VLANs to segregate customers
on a layer 2 level, instead preferring some strange layer 3
implementation.  When we witnessed an unexpected massive (7-8mbit/sec)
increase in inbound traffic, only to find that the destination IPs of
these packets were for another customer in a completely different
netblock/area of the Fremont facility, we were told by support "that's
impossible".  Full tcpdump captures were given, and we were told "this
makes no sense, this can't happen".  4-5 hours later, we were told the
root cause was "a customer who had misconfigured their load balancer".
Right.

I will never forget the two separate times there were full-scale power
outages both caused by "UPS maintenance".  Gas generators?  They have
them, but when I asked why they didn't kick in, I was told "we don't
know".  When I asked if there would be a follow-up investigation as
to why that didn't happen, so the issue wouldn't recur, I was told
"probably".

I will never forget the "maintenances" that we were never told of,
because scheduled maintenances are not announced to customers.  I was
left with the impression they're done on a whim vs. scheduled.

Safe to say when our contract ended, we left.

I will not recommend Hurricane Electric to anyone who wants co-location
with reliable, redundant connectivity.  I *will* recommend them for
cheap "I just need a 1U box stuck somewhere and don't really care about
quality" co-location, although compared to some of their competitors,
they're actually more expensive.

Also, if HE or HE customers read this and want to flame/argue/do
burn-outs in a Pacer over this -- don't bother.  I won't be responding
to any mails.  Why?  Because all outages/incidents witnessed, including
the above, were sent to our account rep. when we were asked "why aren't
you renewing?" I received no response past that point.

I'll leave you with this: if FMT2 had redundancy, then how were things
hard down for over an hour?  Think about it.

This will happen if using Cisco's private VLANs (PVLANs) in an isolated or 
community mode on the switch.  Because of the way most load balancers work 
in the layer 2 environment, the traffic ends up being broadcast to all 
switch ports in the group.  My guess is they had customers bridged over to 
the next-hop using PVLANs, so that customers were theoretically isolated 
at a layer 2 level.  Of course, PVLANs don't provide any true isolation.

This is just speculation about their setup based on what you describe, but 
I've seen this in practice with PVLANs, and it seems it to be plausible.

Our 10MB circuit from NY to SanFran took a hit about an 90 minutes ago and doesn't want to come back up. The Yipes NOC isn't answering. Anyone know anything?

About 20 minutes ago, my copy of Pidgin 2.4.1 for Linux started popping me up
a dialogue box every couple of minutes that it could not retrieve my buddy 
list from AIM.  That the list was not gone, it just couldn't access it.

YMSG seems to be working fine.

Dumped the client and restarted, no change.

Kopete, for it's part, says it's online, and has cached user/group counts
about where I'm expecting... nope, it just popped a can't connect dialogue.

Did AIM fall over?

I'm pretty sure downforeveryone isn't that smart...

Cheers,

Yes, it appears to be back up.

Pidgin is at version 2.6.2, which works fine here (just re-connected).
