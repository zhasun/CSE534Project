Did anyone notice a wide spread internet problem around 11:30 today?  We had
a bunch of customers in Utah not able to access our servers in Atlanta.  We
also saw some of our ITSP gateways become unresponsive in the Dallas area.

We lost roughly 300 Texas area teleworkers from 13:20 to 13:35 EST.
Mostly Comcast and Time Warner connections, most of which are normally
utilizing level3 backbone connections.

There is a thread going on NANOG as well but yes many are reporting
reachability issues through Level 3.  No root cause yet as far as I have
seen.

Yes; we have Level3 as an upstream provider and we have denied routes to and
from them.  I am on hold to place a trouble ticket; they stated that they
currently have a larger than normal call volume.

Yes.  We had numerous services go out with Level3 including VoIP and
transit.  An associate of mine had similar issues and isolated at least
some of them to Dallas.

All seems to be ok now.

Is anyone else having problems routing through level 3 in the past hour?
Seems that I can't get to VA from PHX using Level 3.

Wow. Something must have been up.

I noticed some issues with paths that normally take XO (Bay Area) ->
TWTC and XO (Bay Area) -> Qwest right around the same time. I don't
believe that we use Level3 for these paths, but we definitely took a
latency and path reliability hit.

Makes me wonder what the root cause here is.

Keeping on monitoring....

Cheers,
jof

 From L3's portal:

8/1/11 7:12:56 PM GMT The IP NOC reports that the network equipment self 
restored, resolving the routing issue and restoring services at 
approximately 17:55 GMT. The IP NOC states that they will continue to 
work with Level 3 OPS Engineers and the equipment vendor to isolate the 
root cause of the service interruption. The Level 3 TSC has confirmed 
that all customer services have been restored and the IP NOC will 
continue to monitor for stability.

8/1/11 6:29:26 PM GMT The IP NOC reports that a routing issue failure 
between Dallas, TX and Los Angeles, CA is impacting IP services in 
multiple markets. The IP NOC has engaged the equipment vendor, as well 
as Level 3 OPS Engineers and continues to investigate to isolate the 
issue at this time.

Our upstream provider started re-announcing our prefixes to Qwest this
morning and we had no issues.  I assume Qwest resolved it over the weekend.


Our upstream provider never got a response from Qwest on the trouble ticket
because they said that AS5056 wasn't a customer of theirs.  So they had to
open up another ticket with Qwest to address that mistake (they've had this
issue with Qwest before, apparently).

Yes, there's definitely some issues with our IPv6 transit traffic through
Qwest.  We've filtered off announcements to/from Qwest.  Hurricane Electric
was still using Qwest though, with Qwest (attempting to) use Internap to get
to us.  So, we've had tofilter off Internap as well.

This definitely points to an issue within Qwest's network, so we've opened a
ticket with them to get this resolved.

Anyone see anything odd happen with AT&T routes? 

We lost a decent of people with Time Warner- to AT&T based routes
originating in OH and connecting to NJ a little before 3pm today EST. 

Here's a few traces to show direction and hops.

We saw a partner site go down when AIS lost power - it has been back for at least  3-4 hours now.

AT&T backbone issues 08/04/2011 1230pm - 5pm CDT?

Did anyone else notice any problems on the ATT backbone yesterday?  We had
one VPN tunnel go down (out of 8) and found the problem was within the ATT
internet infrastructure.  After being transferred around ATT for about 2
hours, the problem seemed to resolve itself.

We are in Baton Rouge. LA and our VPN connect from here to Connecticut.  We
found that packets from Connecticut were reaching us here, but were not
gettting back to Connecticut.  Our tracert failed at 12.81.24.97.  After the
problem resolved itself, we were able to continue on to 74.175.192.22.

Subject: [outages] DNS lookups around 12:30 PDT/ edgesuite.net resolution
	failures
Message-ID: <CAJGHyrEzFwXv-e6LOfbaxdrTxT-ZB9-eX1D+f+sbXxR3PHQ9dQ@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone seen anything interesting this afternoon with DNS resolution?

Around 12:30 PDT we saw edgesuite.net records begin to disappear for
both my sites and some other sites like Microsoft, ZDNet at the same
time. Unofficially Akamai has confirmed they also saw this internally
and are investigating, I have a case open with them.

I've heard some random reports of 'global dns problems' but that of
course does not mean much. Did anyone else see anything interesting in
the DNS world between 12:30 and 12:45 PTD today? Specifically, failing
to resolve high profile records such as edgesuite.net.

Any information about what others saw during this time frame would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks everyone!

Yes, I did, but it restored within 10 minutes of me noticing it.

We saw the same issue at the same time from both west and east coast, US.
Case opened with Akamai as well.

Yes, we received many timeout alerts from my.keynote.com (which happens to
use Akamai for dns), McAfee's Scan Alert also timed out due to having dns on
akamai's network.

It looks like they were having some "connectivity issues" in Northern
Virginia which were apparently resolved just a few minutes ago. This is
in addition to the fiasco they are having in their Ireland zone having
to do with some damaged electrical equipment.

It was one of AIS's facilities that lost power (Lightwave). It "only"
took down the network, from my perspective. I have a large
installation there, and none of my equipment lost power.

Yes, right now EC2 seems to be having global problems. Most sites famous for
being hosted on EC2 are now dead (reddit.com being just one example). I
suspect the following URL will be updated with more info as it becomes
available:

Megapath just had a national outage on their VOIP service.  My service

If your Megapath VOIP is still down it should be returning shortly.

It wasn't just voice.  I have a customer with 2 T1's via 
Speakeasy/Megapath in the Chicago area.  Their service went down around 
13:45 CDT and came back just before 16:00 CDT.

Guys, come on. You can't be serious with this. It's like you're
skipping even basic troubleshooting or identification of a potential
problem entirely. Knowing Raman, he sent this from his couch because
he saw a little degradation while streaming an episode of Entourage.
Nevermind that in his time zone, it's near dinner time, his TV's media
unit is probably on wireless, and his wife is more than likely cooking
dinner. Heating up a side dish is no reason to assume there's a
network outage or degradation that could possibly be noticed all the
way to Canada.

Netflix's service infrastructure is a varied beast that involves
Amazon's cloud services and no less than two CDNs, if not three. Make
the effort, instead of making noise.

find kind of offensive!

I understand your point and yes I should have paid more attention to the
posting - will give you that.  I'm quite familiar with their infrastructure.
But wasting a full paragraph on his wife cooking vs just getting to the

Seriously people. There are thousands of us on this list that use it FOR REAL. Some one having an issue with degraded Netflix streaming or they can&apos;t pull up their Facebook page is an abuse of this fine instrument we have for REAL problems.

Fibers cuts, Level3 ATM switches going down, EC2 AZ problems, etc. are real and service affecting to those of us that run networks and companies. Not one person&apos;s evening entertainment quality being reduced.

Can I please propose that we police ourselves enough to know that if what we are posting doesn&apos;t affect a large populous OR isn&apos;t germain to our livelihoods (network admins, techs, engineers, NOC personnel at any common carrier or ISP, etc) that it not be posted?

Today, any email from OUTAGES commands attention, respect and is a community, voluntary call to action -- like ringing the bell in an old west town. Let&apos;s please keep it that way.

Well, our 'charter' (posted on the wiki), says:

"""
Our primary focus tends to be Critical Internet Infrastructure such as IXPs, DNS root servers, major carriers, major data center, carrier hotel, COs, etc., related outages, but other sorts of things -- telecom/BlackBerry problems, AIM dying again, etc -- are certainly within our scope here as well. For years many have argued ?what constitutes critical infrastructure?. A single clear cut definition has yet to be devised.

Infrastructure is constantly changing; a moving target, so to speak, and what's important to one may not be as important to others. You are welcome to adopt whatever definition of 'criticality' you like. 
"""

We've discussed in the past the fact that eyeball networks contain lots
of paying customers who do, in fact, care if they can't get to Netflix or
Facebook, and that their money makes the issue on-topic for this list.

That said, I will agree that a *bit* more investigation is called for,
both by people who are inquiring, and people who are reporting for good
or ill.

Please see my next posting on that point.

Excellent viewpoint.

Message-ID: <25812520.158.1313418961993.JavaMail.root@benjamin.baylink.com>

When you're reporting an outage to the list based on something *other* than
your own trouble ticket with a carrier, please -- in our continuing attempt
to keep postings on this list as productive and high S/N as possible:

Do Your Homework.

===

Don't just ask "is X down?"; there are websites for that.

Please try to have 3 indications that there might be a problem past the 
edge of your own network before you post -- *and include what they are*.

If you're replying to someone's inquiry, do your own pings and traces and 
MTR -r's, and include those in the posted replies.

This is for two reasons: it will reduce trivial postings, and it will make
the ones that filter through *much* more useful to both the poster, and
everyone else who reads them.

REMEMBER: this list is a forward to many users' mobile mailboxes.  Please
think before you post.  Conversations to outages-discussion.

And as usual, thanks to Jared @ Puck for hosting us.

Cheers,
-- jra

Might I suggest that a Criteria be outlined for what constitutes an acceptable post to the outages list if this bothers people so much?
That way when someone posts an email.  They can simply be redirected to that URL instead of 6 emails upset about the face someone
asked if Netflix/Facebook was down for some or all.

So far we have:
1. Fiber Cuts
2. Level3 ATM Switches Down
3. Cloud Service outtages (e.g. Amazon EC2)

Just a suggestion from a lurker.  If it's already been established could I have the link?

Thanks,
Mike Schuler

Seriously people. There are thousands of us on this list that use it FOR
REAL. Some one having an issue with degraded Netflix streaming or they
can&apos;t pull up their Facebook page is an abuse of this fine instrument
we have for REAL problems.

Fibers cuts, Level3 ATM switches going down, EC2 AZ problems, etc. are real
and service affecting to those of us that run networks and companies. Not
one person&apos;s evening entertainment quality being reduced. 

Can I please propose that we police ourselves enough to know that if what we

our livelihoods (network admins, techs, engineers, NOC personnel at any
common carrier or ISP, etc) that it not be posted?

But wasting a full paragraph on his wife cooking vs just getting to the

Guys, come on. You can't be serious with this. It's like you're
skipping even basic troubleshooting or identification of a potential
problem entirely. Knowing Raman, he sent this from his couch because
he saw a little degradation while streaming an episode of Entourage.
Nevermind that in his time zone, it's near dinner time, his TV's media
unit is probably on wireless, and his wife is more than likely cooking
dinner. Heating up a side dish is no reason to assume there's a
network outage or degradation that could possibly be noticed all the
way to Canada.

Netflix's service infrastructure is a varied beast that involves
Amazon's cloud services and no less than two CDNs, if not three. Make
the effort, instead of making noise.

Something that causes a lot of phone calls by end users.  A service impact
that end users experience.

Netflix being down is worth posting.  One stream that buffered for a moment
at one location is NOT.

they too have a ticket open with Level3! However, Level3 tells us there 
are no open tickets!

Not sure if it's related, but our Level3 Seattle/Portland circuit is
showing high packet loss within Seattle.

Customer's other provider is Lightpath (ASN 6128). Their upstream is 
Cablevision. Lightpath reports a master ticket open with Cablevision 
referencing multiple customers reporting sporadic issues with Level3.

Guess we just need to wait it out ...

Message-ID: <CAHDg04s9x-52294TrcCzE8taEHv4UKK0HK9oVN+8zXwAbOXtMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Just dropping a note that I'm getting random 500 and 502 errors from
youtube (Blackfood Communications is my ISP, in Clinton, MT)  If
anyone from Google/Youtube wants to follow up I did capture a couple
of the (apparently base64 encoded) debug dumps on the 500 error pages
-- assuminj they actually mean anything.  I also got an Apache
internal server error saying to contact web at youtube.com -- which was
REALLY weird and made me wonder if my ISP was redirecting my traffic.

Saw cell flow stop from the east coast going to  2 sites, Ohio and South Dakota.  After the brief interruption the latency has increased to both sites. Seems like a fiber cut or re- route. The same thing happened earlier this week. Has anyone else seen any issues? This began around 8:50 pm EDT.

All Cellphones are busy in MD. I'm guessing it's from everyone trying to
call at the sames time. Both ATT and Verizon Wireless.  (Voice busy.
Data seems to be working).

The only problem I've confirmed was cell phones; networks acting 
saturated rather than hard failure.  All other reports of problems I've 
heard appear to be traceable to people doing things like calling their 
own cell phones to confirm that their desk phone worked and then 
reporting it as a desk phone failure.

Subject: [outages] Telecheck and Other Credit processes down?
Message-ID: <CA+mvWe=1JfPU_3WdZ4-zqBZC7GiCSvoLAPkx4TBGXzDvXLTGbQ@mail.gmail.com>

I've had three retailers in three geographically different call me in
the last 30 minutes complaining of Telecheck and their primary credit
card processors timing out.  They've tried to fail back from IP to
Dial-up, but even those are down right now.

Anyone noticing anything similar?

Solving site load issues with database replication is a lot like
solving your own personal problems with heroin -- at first, it sorta
works, but after a while things just get out of hand.

Paymentech seems to be up, so it is not something widespread among all
payment card processors.

Latest we have is they're powerless in 2 datacenters. No word on which
datacenters, but somewhere between Norwich and New Haven Connecticut.

Guessing there's a number of Fibertech business users w/o service along
the shoreline. I heard either here or elsewhere that Fibertech is known to
be in places with no generators and/or bad UPS--guessing that is true at
this point.

I haven't experienced any outages in the NYC/ NYC Metro area as of yet
(I don't have any int'l with L3 though - mine are a mix of domestic
TDM, IP and Ethernet circuits.)

Subject: So Cal Verizon FIOS Issues?

I was curious if anyone else is seeing huge problems from Verizon FIOS
connected sites in Southern California reaching large segments of the
Internet?  It appears that Verizon has lost something large in Los Angeles
and it's affecting hundreds of our customers.  Lack of connectivity to
various places around the Internet...  It's really odd because sites that
are located in adjacent cities can get further than their neighbors, but
fail in the end (some go to LAX and die, others get routed to DFW and die).
Large swaths of CDN's are not able to be connected to from any of the sites.

Curious what others are seeing.

(To those clicking, note the hyphen on the end of the URL; some clients
drop this).

The last page of said thread also Verizon may have replaced a router or
something along those lines (highly speculative given the user base).

And my usual question applies: where's the redundancy?  (Hell, I wasn't
even aware SoCal *had* Verizon FIOS, if only they'd bring that to the
Bay....)

Message-ID: <-599563044037559874@unknownmsgid>

A few hours ago we saw multiple DS3s go down in Central NY and the
Capital District. Verizon is not being forthcoming with a cause. I
suspect they were mucking with something already in protect path, but
I wonder if anyone knew more.
