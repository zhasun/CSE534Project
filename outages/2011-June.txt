C'mon Andrew, you say you've been in this business a decade, you should know
better than that.  Which sites specifically?  Do you have an example URL? Is
the site totally unreachable, or are there latency or packet loss issues, or
other problems?  Any error messages?  What software/protocol(s) were involved -
was this an IE-only problem, or was it FTP or streaming video or other?   Any
ping or traceroute results that demonstrate the issue?

I am seeing similar issues to two sites in the UK, one of which is bbc.co.uk.  The other is speedwellweather.com.  Traceroutes work fine, but packet captures show a lot of TCP retransmissions, duplicate ACKs, and sessions just end up resetting.

One of my employees is reporting that Cox told her a backhoe "cut a main line" somewhere in the Alexandria, Virginia area earlier this morning.  More than likely a fiber cut I'd imagine.  Apparently it's affecting about 50,000 residential customers and has been down since 5 a.m.

Anyone have more info?

Level3 is claiming a fiber cut somewhere, anyone have any info?

The last fibercut/manhole fire down in NYC took over two days to repair, I hope that's not the case yet again.

Subject: [outages] XO in DC/Herndon: Can only ping even numbered IPs?
Message-ID: <BANLkTimSuB4i1wLtvtfS0eBXphFPY1i0WQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings list,

We have a few customers in the Fairfax County/Washington DC area with
XO-provided T1 circuits that can only access hosts with an EVEN
numbered last octet in their IP address.

For example I personally host a server in Equinix Ashburn (with
Carpathia) on a /28 and the XO T1's can only ping the EVEN numbered
IPs, for example:
209.222.152.120 - can ping/http/etc
209.222.152.121 - no access
209.222.152.122 - can ping/http/etc
209.222.152.123 - no access

The is doubly-confirmed via traceroute as only even numbered routers'
responses make it back.

Getting very slow/doubtful responses from XO support so I'm just
reaching out to this list to see if anyone else is affected.

I assume this is some sort of load balancing/spreading algorithm.

Certainly never saw this particular outage before during my 15 years
in the industry.

Thanks all.

Having problems in Westmont and Saint Charles as well (problems making

XO recently implemented automatic abuse-related filtering at their edge
routers.  You may want to check to make sure these individual IPs aren't
triggering one of the automatic filtering rules that null routes the /32s.

Hope this helps,

This speaks very strongly of a link-aggregation scheme with an
undetected link failure. Many implementations can hash based on the
destination IP address to load balance traffic across multiple links.

Some NSPs don't properly implement a link aggregation negotiation
protocol like LACP or PAGP and just leave things in an enabled state.
This leads to failures like this.

Level3 seems to have an outage like this every 6 - 9 months, I've found.

William sir,

I wish it were that simple.  Even google.com and cnn.com's
odd-numbered round-robin DNS IPs are unreachable, along with the
odd-numbered IPs of any intermediary routers after our second hop.

Jonathan Lassoff probably hit the nail on the head with a failed
link-aggregation scheme; of course XO hasn't provided any explanation
yet.

Nobody else in the Fairfax, VA region with an XO-provided T1's is
experiencing this one?

Thanks everyone for your responses.

Yup.  BW is down hard.  Their BW7 server is/was down and their BW9 server isn't kicking in.

Google Voice is down but a few calls have gone through.

I can see that their BW7 server seems to be slowly coming back to life and sporadically calls are coming through.

Our Service is fine in South Carolina. In and Out?

Not sure if everyone else is this way.. But we have 2 SIP trunk peers on our upstream connection and I see calls come in from both periodically.

Not seeing any issues here in Colorado - we have 2 trunks and use them
(round-robin) for, mostly, outbound calls - both trunks working fine - no
issues today...

Looks to be re-directing to www.godaddymobile.com for me.  Incidentally godaddymobile.com loads.

On Go Daddy's Twitter page they are saying "We're working on it, don't worry. Use godaddymobile.com in the interim if you need in now. Thanks for your patience."

We use InterNAP as one of our upstreams and they sent us a notice saying that they've shut down their Global Crossing BGP session for the second time in 24 hours.  The first time they said they were seeing severe packet loss through Global Crossing.  This morning they said the BGP session was flapping.

Hey folks, is anyone aware of any problems happening right now with
Layer42, or within the PAIX?

We're seeing issues reaching both www.google.com (going through the
PAIX) as well as www.facebook.com (going through the PAIX).  Packets not
going through the PAIX appear to be working fine.

Below are traceroutes showing the problem.  And yes, it's still ongoing
as of right now (20:43 PDT).

FWIW, my connectivity via Layer42's network (at their 1555 Plymouth (MV) facility) appears to be fine, including to www.'('facebook'|'google')'.com.   Same appears true via IPv4 and IPv6.

True as of 21:20 GMT-7.   I didn't get your email until just now, so perhaps there was a problem that has since cleared up.

The problem hasn't cleared up.  Instead, it appears in both cases
someone has induced reconvergence/route priority to route *around* the
PAIX.  It looks like San Jose is now exclusively in use.

Here's what mtrs look like to both Google and Facebook; compare them to
the previous.

What you saw was probably related to this, as we saw a few peers flapping during that time period.

Parry,

I can confirm, performance-wise, things improved after seeing network
reconvergence utilising San Jose instead of the PAIX.  But as I've left
the office for the day and don't have remote access to the machines on
our network which have ICMP permitted; I won't be able to confirm until
Monday.

Appears streaming to devices is still functioning.  For the past 2-3 hours I have been watching movies streamed to my xbox, and watching a TV show at this moment :)  just north of Denver here.

And here's the wrap:

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-20/netflix-restores-website-watch-instantly-service-after-outage.html

No musing from anyone whether the US Air, UA, and NetFlix outages have
anything to do with Anon or Lulz.

(Except from @McGarrysGhost :-)

i can also confirm that there have been dns issues starting in the
morning (CEST), worsening in the afternoon.

i switched the domain to our own nameservers and did not follow up on
this issue though...

Was trying to get to www.osdir.com this morning and dns queries were
failing. Investigating, seems that it's a result of an outage for dns.com -
am unable to get to any of their name servers, or their web site. Checking
mxtools.com, they concur that there's a problem:

Error:

I take that back -- I can hit dns.com's website.

We're seeing some weird time-outs involving content coming from our

Think there might be a larger issue at hand?

All I've had reports of so far are involving dns.com servers - or access to
them. Checking of paths to them don't show me any downed or what would
appear to be overloaded routes. Definite timeouts querying the dns.com name
servers though.....

Just tested again and see no problems now and testing on mxtoolbox.com works
not as well....

Does anyone know geographically where the authoritative nameservers in
question were located?

The reason I ask: there was a fibre cut within XO's network near SF
(specifically 529 Bryant and Fremont) that correlates almost directly,
time-wise, with when Chris began seeing this problem.  Splicing took
about an hour.

All I have is this:

An interruption with our long-haul circuit between the west and east
coast (Sunnyvale CA to Ashburn VA) was witnessed at 07:18 PDT, seen
closest to the Ashburn end.  I don't have an exact end time.

XO told us the issue was caused by "a fibre issue at 529 Bryant and
Fremont", stating resolution was achieved by "splicing the fibre".

I can't give out our ticket number, and XO does not disclose master
ticket numbers; they tie per-customer ticket numbers to the master
ticket.

If you have a contract with XO and are concerned, I would recommend

The reason I ask: there was a fibre cut within XO's network near SF (specifically 529 Bryant and Fremont) that correlates almost directly, time-wise, with when Chris began seeing this problem.

I am seeing the same issue with a new "Business" FIOS install in Montgomery
County MD.  I followed the trail through traceroute throwing pings at each
hop.  The hop-that-drops is google-gw.customer.alter.net.  I have had a case
open with Verizon for several days, however they have been short on concern
or info.
