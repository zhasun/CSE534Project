NOC responded later that there was one BGP peer on that router that was
causing havoc for other BGP sessions.

Anyone else seeing BGP sessions over HE IPv6 tunnels go up and down?  It's
been happening since 7:36 pm Central.  I open a ticket with the NOC via
e-mail, but since I've received no response I can only presume that they're
in the midst of working through the issue.

  Confirmed fiber cut of a OC-48, still dead, Philadelphia metro area, 
and the current status report is:

"Michael(20:43:14): Your circuit is impacted by a cable cut. Technicians 
are still at work. In the North Pit, they have excavating the damage and 
they are prepping the cable for splicing. In the South Pit, they are 
still excavating the damage."

No hint as to how much more was cut at the same time or ETR.  But I was 
thanked for choosing Verizon.  :-)

This is very similar to an XO OC-48 fiber cut that happened back in July. 
Same areas were effected, South Jersey and Phila. XO was down for 27 
hours. The OC-48 may well have been Verizon - wonder whats going in Jersey 
with these OC-48 cuts?

I've seen plenty of SONET "rings" where both sides are in the same cable. Not too much protection when doing things that way...

I think the southern cross cable system had some customers that discovered several years back that running production traffic on both sides of your ring can seem like a great way to double capacity until a major storm goes through and blows away one of the cables and you don't have any capacity left for protection on the remaining side of the ring.

A problem probably as old as chariots.

Management does not understand the notion of "spares".  They understand
paying for stuff in revenue service, and does not understand paying for
stuff not in revenue service.

Then management wasn't charging appropriately.  It wouldn't be seen as a
'spare', then.

I just used their web site as a convenient test handle.  My customers
did not want me to publish their nets to broadview that were down.

The major part of the outage was 4 hours long. outages.org took 6 hours
to send my message, so by the time you got my alert the event had
mostly passed.

How do I report on outage  ofoutages.org?

At 4:30pm PDT Broadview has an ACD answering the phones again but is
reporting continuing network stability issues and I can still not get
a human on the line.

Is it just their website thats down, or do you have BVN circuits that are 
down? If circuits, which market? Most of Broadview's markets are 
acquisition, so if BVN circuits in Phila, PA area are down, its the old 
ATX network, and so on. I know alot of people from the old ATX so if its 
Philly area (south jersey, delaware), I could probably find out whats 
going on.

I have circuits that are down, but their website (and phones) were down for
about 4 hours.

Just got through after 45 mins to a support person. They are releasing
very little info.  Seems like the circuits in the NYC area that
Broadview resells from Covad and Verizon are the ones that have been
having problems.  Just had another blip here, so the event is now 9 hours
old.

No ETA on a final fix.

For what its worth, Philly appears to be fine.

I have a switch in Broadview's Philadelphia POP - its actually in their 
core Telco room. The switch itself is for some Zayo fiber bridging for a 
private IP wireless application, but the switch has a plain old public 
GigE fiber link from Broadview's core for IP access. I can hit it now from 
home (Comcast), getting 8ms latency, hitting the following hops:

I'm hitting BVN from a Cogent peer in NYC (JFK), then its BVN onnet down 
to phila as the next hop is the old ATX switch. BVN bought ATX in 2007.

- --------------------
In the future you can either contact me directly and /or
admins at outages.org. Same has been noted in monthly list faq.

JFYI, puck is also busy hosting 'cisco-nsp' list which is a very busy
list and maybe the filesystem burped, not sure. This is still no excuse.

Will look into it.

Fabric card in large distribution router was dropping lots of packets. Took a while to reroute around it.

Major effect was in NYC and to a lesser extent some intercity Internet transit

Was mostly restored by 8:30 PM EDT

Has anyone been able to find out what is going on with XO? We're showing
spotty connectivity all over their network, and I got disconnected from
their PNA support number with a "technical difficulties" message. I'm
hoping maybe someone on here knows something?

Anyone having slowness through XO? Just looked at internetpulse.net, and they're pretty much red across the board. We are having serious packet loss through their network.

Anyone aware of a large fiber cut in Norcal affecting ATT, XO and I am sure
many others?

Anyone have any additional detail?  Master ticket?  Estimated repair time?

Called XO.  Got to support queue, got message:

"Thank you for calling XO.  We are currently experiencing technical difficulties, and are unable to take your call."

Then it hung up on me.

Fantastic.

Website is down/not pingable. The phone lines for XO all say its a DNS  
resolving issue.

A few of my DS-1 circuits are down, and a few have serious packet  
loss. But some are up?!

I am currently seeing a lot of issues with (currently) unknown carriers and
our VoIP calls.  We use Bandwidth.com for outbound calls, and I know that XO
is one of their upstream providers.  We are seeing dropped calls, garbled
audio.  I have a ticket opened with them, but I don't think they have
identified the issue yet.

I'd also be curious if anyone has any information.

Our data was completely down for almost an hour (returned at 1055 CDT)
.  We're in the Dallas area (Plano).  Things are working now (though
it seems as at least a few XO peers we do business with are still
routing through other upstreams).

No issues with Voice, other than what you mentioned, being
disconnected from the PNA number.

Seeing this here  as well, of course XO in their usual fashion has no outage
notices posted on their site.  We saw the issues starting at 10:56 AM EST,
and although they are better now we still have at least 1 customer in NY
complaining.

"XO Engineers are telling us that they are aware of packet loss across their

connectivity out of St. Louis and Nashville but Atlanta and Dallas are
problem free."

My Philly circuits appear to be coming back up.

I'm on the phone with Xo now. There systems are so jammed up, they  
can't even create my ticket - computer locks up, I've been on hold for  
30 minutes just waiting for the ticket number to be created so I can  
reference later for credit.

Did anyone just experience a loss of connectivity thru NYC?  11:50-11:55

Seemed to be dying at Level 3.    Could not reach multiple hosts in

XO began advertising way too many prefixes, a few hours ago.  Most likely tripping most of their peers max-prefix limits. Filters are your friends.

I have gig service to XO in Minneapolis.  I'm having problems with some websites, and no problems with others.  www.internetpulse.net shows major latency from XO to several other providers.

Anyone have any additional detail?  Master ticket?  Estimated repair time?

Apparently the person I spoke to within XO said they were having
headless chicken syndrome and that they were in the midst of bringing up
sessions and that was the extend of the information I received.

Hopefully we'll see some sort of lesson learned from this.

Our datacenter in Salt Lake City forwarded us this message from XO:

 

"I wanted to give notice in case you were having issues connecting to
various websites today.  There is a problem with a peering router which
allows XO's network to connect to outside networks.  Impact appears to
be pretty broad due to the volume of routes that egress/ingress that
peer.   Our Engineering is working to correct.  We don't have an
estimated time for resolution just yet, but this our top priority issue
right now and all levels of our repair organization are engaged."

I am currently seeing a lot of issues with (currently) unknown carriers

calls, garbled audio.  I have a ticket opened with them, but I don't

I've been told that there were "peering issues" and that there has not been an official "all clear" issued internally yet.

The thing that most concerned be about this issue is that when we figure out XO was having issues, we dropped our peering session with them but they appear to have continued to announce our routes -- at least in some areas. We haven't brought that up with them yet but will soon.

I'd also be curious if anyone has any information.

Our data was completely down for almost an hour (returned at 1055 CDT)
.  We're in the Dallas area (Plano).  Things are working now (though
it seems as at least a few XO peers we do business with are still
routing through other upstreams).

No issues with Voice, other than what you mentioned, being
disconnected from the PNA number.

 We also saw a lot of packet loss on our XO circuit and their support
phones did not answer, nor was their website available. 

A separate vendor, who peers with XO says that the put a limit on the
number or routes accepted from peers this morning.  Our issues were
resolved at approximately 08:45am Pacific time.

Yes, we received a call from a customer in Atlanta on Covad.  They go through XO
to reach us and they are dropping their VPN connections.

This morning we're experiencing timeouts to and from a lot of sites.
I heard through the grapevine that XO instituted some new route limits
on their peers.  Their site at http://businesscenter.xo.com is down,
their phone number 800-424-0583 is fast busy and their Premier
National Accounts 866-295-9696 reports "we are currently experiencing
technical difficulties and cannot take your call" then DISCONNECT.

UPDATE
One of my other vendors says that they have resolved it and it seems

Seeing all kinds of instability with XO on the west coast (SFO and Irvine, CA specifically). Interface /30s are intermittently unreachable and appear to be intermittently in and out of BGP based on L3's LG. Internetpulse.net looks pretty bad for XO as well. Anyone have any details?

XO has confirmed they are experiencing a "national IP outage". Very few details available from their repair groups at this time. XO master ticket is 2165336.

XO supposedly leaked a bunch of routes (2nd hand info), had at least one internal routing loop between NYC & DC (1st hand info).  They had massive reachability problems across the USA (1st hand info).

They supposedly fixed the problem(s) starting at 12:14 EDT today, and reachability should return to normal (info from XO).  But we are still seeing at least some locations having issues at 12:38 EDT.

Other reports here in the last hour suggest it was the opposite: XO suddenly 
started *sending* a vastly increased number of presumably bogus routes to 
their peers, many of whom tripped filter rules, and either shut the sessions
down, or limited them and picked the wrong routes to drop.

I expect it will be tomorrow before we assemble a coherent picture of what
the actual outage was.  Anyone check Renesys' blog yet?

I don't know if this was caused by the volume of messages regarding the XO issue or if outages.org possibly was affected by xo. I have seen in the past the outages list run behind.

Some people don't post regularly and were being held by milter-greylist.

I've now exempted @outages.org from greylist.

Please direct hate mail at me.

- ---------------------
You are correct in pointing this delay and Jared just addressed this
issue similar to what others have reported in the past.

Apparently the messages slowness was due to anti-spam greylist filtering
and this should be fixed starting now. Then again please let us know if
you notice it again.

Sorry about that.

Hey all,

We are seeing lots of route churn on our level3 bgp uplinks in Dallas and LA. Networks we are seeing being withdrawn and announced back look to be XO, Global Crossing and HE.


Anyone else seeing similar?

Thanks!

Hello All,

First of all, I thank everyone for being patient during this morning
drill when messages were being delayed as this may have caused further
duplication of messages.

The delayed messages issue has been addressed (credit, Jared), it was
caused due to anti-spam greylist filtering for outages.org which was
temporarily holding email(s) from senders it did not recognize. As puck
went through the process of approving mail and releasing them, this
caused delays.

This was causing disruption to the near-instantaneous nature of email
people have come to expect.

Like always, please feel free to contact us if you see any further issues.


grateful thanks,

Seeing this here  as well, of course XO in their usual fashion has no outage
notices posted on their site.  We saw the issues starting at 10:56 AM EST,
and although they are better now we still have at least 1 customer in NY
complaining.

Has anyone been able to find out what is going on with XO? We're showing
spotty connectivity all over their network, and I got disconnected from
their PNA support number with a "technical difficulties" message. I'm hoping
maybe someone on here knows something?

I saw an abnormal increase in traffic since I do a lot of secondary MX
and DNS type services. Traffic is starting to go back to normal now.

Subject: [outages] Cogeco mail issues?
Message-ID: <151BC03492E46E4CB8D479E42CEF78900119E315@exchange.wtc.local>

Howdy,

Since about 6:50 AM EDT (GMT -04:00) all of our outbound mail hosts have
been getting a mix between timeouts and the following back from
mx.cogeco.ca (216.221.81.26):

	421 #4.4.5 Too many connections to this listener.

I tried from a few IPs in subnets that have no previous reputation (that
I know of, anyway) and am getting the same thing. Is anyone else
experiencing this?

Thanks

Based on Pete Cashmore's comments at Mashable, I think not, but we'll see.  
It's just come back up and is slowly rolling out, both vertically and
horizontally.

Just to provide the customary reminder: for some of us, "taking calls about 
why customers can't get to Facebook" *is* working.

It used to be a long time ago, but after a few years I wanted to stab
people over the phone. I paid my dues on the front line. This was long
before the social networking era so I can only imagine how much worse it
could be now.

The most awesome call I ever witnessed was someone arguing to one of my
coworkers over speakerphone for 45 minutes that the O'Reilly Factor
website had to have the ' in the URL because "it is in his name". The
customer absolutely refused to remove the apostrophe, claimed we were
censoring, etc. At one point he hit mute, picked up the monitor, pointed
it at the phone, and yelled "look! the site works fine!"

FWIW I can't reach facebook either as of right now (13:10 PDT) either at
work or on my Android via IPv4. However, I *can* access it just fine via
IPv6 at www.v6.facebook.com

Interesting, www.facebook.com switched to an Akamai IP for me at about
19:30 UTC.

Seeing different things from different places, hasn't fully propagated yet.

dig www.facebook.com @8.8.8.8 soa |grep -P '[0-9]{10}'
g.akamai.net.		471	IN	SOA	n0g.akamai.net. hostmaster.akamai.com. 1285274188 1000 1000 1000 1800

So 8.8.8.8 is definitely the older version, and it shows their IP:
dig www.facebook.com @8.8.8.8 +short 
69.63.189.11

And 4.2.2.1 is fresher and appears to show a switch to akamai:
dig www.facebook.com @4.2.2.1 +short 
wwws.ak.facebook.com.edgesuite.net.
a1254.x.akamai.net.
66.160.206.18

Facebook appears to be having some issues.  Unreachable from multiple
providers in this neck of the woods, unreachable from
downforeveryoneorjustme.com, but reachable via AT&T mobile.  I'm sure
customers are going to start bitching soon if they can't get to their
Farmville.

Well, it changed from an external host to our local Akamai servers.  Now
that it is back up, it is back to external servers.

Looks like this might have been an Akamai problem then.

The length of the outage could actually affect Sept productivity. Scary how
many need their Farmville.

Its worth noting that facebook.com and www.facebook.com are handled
differently.  facebook.com is a limited set of RR IPs that redirect to www.
 www is a gslb'ed domain.

Many of my customers cant reach me from behind FioS. Traceroute shows a 
problem spot in Newark in Verizon backbone. 256ms latency at the last hop, 
then dies. 

It several hops within Verizon, so it cant be an Abovenet peering issue.

If anyone from Verizon is listening out there, please look into this. Fios 
support refuses to troubleshoot. I know at least 20 people who have called 
in to complain, there are Verizon (DSL or Fios) through Jersey and 
Delaware.

This isn't to say there's not a problem, but where is the "256ms latency
at the last hop" evidence?  All that's shown here is 3 probes at hop #9
with RTTs of 5.265, 5.202, and 5.259ms.  The copy-paste was done poorly
so the output is formatted badly.

You're going to need to provide traceroutes from both directions
(src->dst and dst->src), and should probably try UDP, TCP, and
ICMP-based traceroutes to rule out filtering at the endpoints.  Some
traceroute implementations also offer a flag (on BSD it's -e, to be used
alongside -p) which causes UDP and TCP destination packets to *not*
increment their port number per probe, which can help if the destination
uses a firewall (and the user has control over it).

When dealing with Verizon, you should probably also indicate if all
forms of packets are being filtered (meaning provide actual packet
traces on both the source and destination ends showing something like
the results of an telnet x.x.x.x yyyy towards you, where yyyy should be
a port you're definitely listening on + have permitted on your firewall
and/or port forwarded).  Basically you want to confirm if the remote end
receives a SYN+ACK response (from you) to their initial SYN.

Good luck.

Apparently, our surmise about Akamai notwithstanding, the problem was actually
internal to their app-specific caching facilities, which went into Sorcerer's
Apprentice mode, and they had to kill them all and let ghod sort them out.

More if I get it; hope that posting's public.

Details of the outage case are at
http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/more-details-on-todays-outage/431441338919

In short, code problem which required them "turn off" the site to resolve.
Nothing to do with Akamai/etc.

Peeringdb.com seems to be down for me. I'm resolving www.peeringdb.com

TCP/80 immediately close, and TCP/443 never sees a ServerHello message

We are working on "v2.0" of the system, but other things got in the way and it is over six months past due.  We will hopefully have some movement soon.

That was a model postmortem. Wish more companies had that sort of
