According to an ICQ.com forum thread, linked to by Slashdot, ICQ has
reportedly started blocking third-party chat clients, such as pidgin.

Users receive a message telling them their "client version is too old".

No further to date.

FWIW, I'm currently logged in via Trillian with no issues.

I think this only has to do with the version of ICQ the client emulates. 
For example Adium version 1.2.5 emulates a version that is actually too 
old and will not work.  So I updated to 1.2.6 which was released yesterday 
(YMMV) and was able to login without any issues.  I think there is also an 
older Adium client that works maybe 1.12 or so.  Also, is this really an 
outage??

I don't think ICQ is blocking anything, because I'm connected from  
Adium and it redirects me to the Pidgin website to get a "new version"  
of the software.  I think it's more of a need for the IM client guys  
to update their crap to the newer ICQ protocol version.

I would think that anything that causes end users to call the support desk because they can't connect is considered an "outage".

No, not any more.  I used to have one, but that webserver crashed hard.

Wiki's are good for *knowledge capture*; they're not really much more
than a glorified, searchable scratch pad.  They, notably, are *not* a
database, a spreadsheet, a mailing list, a newsgroup, or a ticket
tracking system...

Honestly, probably the *best* thing to do is to make
outages-announce at outages.org be an *OTRS Instance*.  New announcements
will start tickets.  Comments on old ones will go the right place.

People who want to see status can monitor the OTRS.  People who want
announcements can subscribe to the list.

Yes, RT would probably work just as well...

Specfically: IRC is bad for this because it *does not leave tracks*
(well, without help).

The tracks are very important.

Ok, I'll expand and formalize my suggestion.

I think that the best approach to this would be to set up an OTRS (or RT)
install which receives the mail for outages@, and which automatically
subscribes all tickets to outages-notify@ *and* outages-discuss at .

The Mailman instance can then handle outages-notify (a broadcast list
which only the OTRS can post to) and outages-discuss, a general
subscription list, where everyone can talk about the tickets, but OTRS
won't hear it.

Users who only want notices subscribe to -notify, users who like the
chat subscribe to -discuss, people who have actual content to
contribute about the outage (which we can all hash out what we mean
by), can actually reply to the OTRS postings to -notify (which must
not mung Reply-To), and those posts will go on the ticket and also to
the two lists.

How's that sound, folks?

Cheers,

Wondering if anyone else is seeing similar problems, or if anyone knows of
any widespread problems with Internap/XO/Savvis that I can pass on to my
customer to let them know what's going on.

Don't know what the issues are, but the gist from tech support is
"Eastern Australia can't connect".

Savvis case number is 1336683, no ETA yet, but engineers are on it.
Savvis confirmed that it is a connectivity issue to Asia/Pac region.

Router: Ivenue bgp1

I'm sure Jared can, if he has the time.  I installed OTRS and it was a
walk-on, though I'm sort of stalled figuring out how best to design my
queue structure for my shop...

I know several list members have already offered to donate time and
hardware to the project. I believe all that is pending is a consensus as
to whether it is valuable to the list as a whole.

Let me un-thread this, so no one misses it.

It has been proposed (by me :-) that we actually set up a ticket
tracker for keeping tabs on outages, with companion -notify and
-discuss mailing lists, as below.

Opinions on this idea, and volunteers to set it up or host it are
hereby (unofficially) solicited.

Ok, I'll expand and formalize my suggestion.

I think that the best approach to this would be to set up an OTRS (or RT)
install which receives the mail for outages@, and which automatically
subscribes all tickets to outages-notify@ *and* outages-discuss at .

The Mailman instance can then handle outages-notify (a broadcast list
which only the OTRS can post to) and outages-discuss, a general
subscription list, where everyone can talk about the tickets, but OTRS
won't hear it.

Users who only want notices subscribe to -notify, users who like the
chat subscribe to -discuss, people who have actual content to
contribute about the outage (which we can all hash out what we mean
by), can actually reply to the OTRS postings to -notify (which must
not mung Reply-To), and those posts will go on the ticket and also to
the two lists.

How's that sound, folks?

I am in support of this idea for the following reason:

There has been a small history of what I will call marginally on topic.
These discussions, though somewhat interesting, don't accomplish much more
than to raise my--already heavy--email load.  With a ticketing system and
companion -notify list this would not be an issue.

The valid scope of what belongs on the list is clearly a matter of
consensus/opinion and will likely never be satisfactorily addressed for
everyone.  With a ticketing system, outages that are in-scope may be
subscribed to, with discussion taking place in the comments while those
that are out of scope are only a single notification and much less of a
bother.

Note: I'm familiar primarily with Bugzilla, but I can only assume that
OTRS and RT have similar subscription/commenting features.

Thanks,

Well, my initial approach was to add the notify list to each ticket, so
that all comments added to the actual ticket would go to notify.

It sounds like you are suggesting that *only the initial Ticket Open
message* go to notify, and anyone who wants to know about specific
tickets can log into OTRS, and add themseves to that ticket, do I have
that right?

Me personally, I'm the sort of person who might want to see *all*
ticket traffic on my blackberry, instead of only the Open messages...

but it's possible that this could be handled by OTRS itself; as a
signed-up user, I could watch the queue in question, and let that
mechanism send me the messages, while -notify only got the initial
Ticket Open messages.  I have to go check the manual, I'm not a wizard
on OTRS yet.

Cheers,

Sounds reasonable. I'd send the -discuss messages to an mbox
to read 'whenever' and could leave the -notify ones in my high
priority inbox. Looks like a win to me.

Yeah, I knew that was there.

My experience of RT is that it doesn't handle well any situation that
can't be described as "Internal ticketing for my department in my
company" -- in particular, I tried to find a way to use it in the
consulting business I worked for, and it didn't have enough degrees of
freedom to get the work done... at least, without integrating Asset
Tracker, and defining each customer as an Asset, which was a bit too
icky for me.

It *appears* OTRS would handle that better, but I can't be sure, since
I'm not done deploying it myself.  Anyone who has OTRS or RT gurus
laying about; point them at this thread.

Cheers,

I know you can be a "Watcher" in RT, which allows you to follow all the
comments/replies on a given queue.

In general, I have had a better experience with RT than OTRS, btw, but I
do not want to start a flamewar around that, you guys choose whatever
you want (or rather, the person/org hosting/managing the service should
get to choose, obviously).

Greetings,

Come monday (7/7) we will be making final transition for the mailing
list to the new domain (outages.org).

With this change we will be splitting the list into 2 sub-list:

outages at outages.org - outages reporting/alerts.
announce at outages.org - notifications related to wiki (coming soon),
change management, future updates, etc.

We will continue to monitor the list further and see if it warrants
'outages-discuss' for any post outages meta-discussion (troubleshooting,
analysis, post-mortem, etc) so it can help alleviate noise and keep
outages reporting brief and to the point.


Let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks for listening/feedback.


regards,
/virendra

Can anyone shed any light on the network fun that seems to be going on about now?  Im getting intermittent packet loss and connectivity failures from qwest/Colorado dsl circuit in brazil and Comcast/Colorado to and from several sites including Chicago and new York.

Anyone else seeing this?

There is a power outage in downtown Vancouver, and apparently Peer1's
UPS and/or Generators have failed.

UPDATE
by cpugsley on Mon Jul 14, 2008 10:10 am

Upon further review the power outage has affected the entire Financial
District. Generator 7 - the main generator in the Harbour Centre
building that powers PEER 1 and other business worked for
approximately 20 minutes after the power went out. The 16th floor data
center and the 21st floor West data center are currently at a 90%
power loss. The 21st floor North is now at 100% power loss. We've also
learned that the UPS power is affected as well.

The Harbour Centre building is working around the clock to restart the
generator as quickly as possible. We will continue to provide updates
as they are received.

Thank you for your continued patience.

Most buildings downtown are without power.  Our collocation facilities
are running on generator power at 200 granville street snf at 515
Hastings (adjacent to Harbour center) are online.  BCHydro does not
expect power to be restored untill at least 3PM PST.



Underground fire causing outage;

>From Canada.com -

http://communities.canada.com/theprovince/blogs/newsroom/default.aspx


The fire apparently started in an underground power vault, five feet
beneath the surface on Richards Street between Dunsmuir and Pender
Streets. The fire blew a manhole cover off.

Officials initially said they would let the fire burn itself out, as it
wasn't accessible. McKay said officials hope the fire hasn't spread, but
it's not clear yet.

Ironically, our gear in the UPS-cursed and outage-plagued Spencer 
building next door are running fine. I guess all that maintenance 
work Peer1's done over the past several months paid off this time? No 
way to know from where I sit in Seattle if the "entire Financial 
District" includes this building, or if they are properly on genset. 
We'll see.

Anyone seeing/heard of any issues with AT&T, possibly in Atlanta?

We are on Charter (business cable) here in the office.  We keep losing
connectivity -- but traceroutes appear to die within att.net in Atlanta.
(Which to me would indicate a problem within AT&T somewhere, not our
connection.)

Also, I've spoken with someone who is using AT&T DSL (business) here in
town, and they are having similar problems getting to the 'net.

Sounds like something is up.  (And the weather IS nice for backhoe
activities...)

When you're having connectivity problems to a site, please at least
post its IP, if not example traces (I use 'mtr -R -C 10' for easier
readability)...

I can't conveniently switch to my other uplink because I'm on the machine
with mtr on it, and my mail session will die.  As you can see, I don't have
AT&T in my path, so the trace probably doesn't tell you much.

Except why I use mtr to post diagnostic traces.  :-)

Just a follow-up/resolution...

To make a long story short, I found out that Charter was having some
hardware issues upstream (on their port facing AT&T.)  Essentially, that
particular connection was flapping, causing all sorts of routing fun.

At the same time, there was some issue going on with AT&T's DSL -- which, as
far as I can tell, was completely unrelated to the Charter issue (other than
that they were happening at the same time.)

All is well now.  Gotta love networking!

     Cheers,
     Jeremy

We saw the connection go down @ 09:14 eastern. It continues to be down

Is anyone aware of any cuts/outages. Also UUnet has been a little weird

Could go either way. My traces last night showed PL all the way to the 
target, and a lot of * / !H / destination unreachable. Tonight I still 
see PL starting at the same point (ae-93-93.csw4.Dallas1.Level3.net), 
but ICMP to the destination is making it through, and I'm not having 
connectivity problems anymore.

Something's still up in Dallas but it may be ICMP getting dropped on the 
floor. Not the norm, though, or at least it wasn't until lately ;)

Subject: [outages] CNet: Amazon S3 experiencing 'elevated error rates' Sunday
Message-ID: <20080721033015.GA17761@cgi.jachomes.com>

 ===
Amazon.com's Simple Storage Service--a major component of its
online computing services--is apparently experiencing problems
Sunday.

The e-tailer's "Service Health Dashboard" reports that the S3
service in both the United States and Europe is experiencing
"elevated error rates."

The outage is causing CenterNetworks images to break, the site
reports, and SmugMug reports that "a large portion of the
photos and videos stored" on S3 are currently offline.

SmugMug seemed sympathetic to Amazon's woes and offered this
advice:

    Every component SmugMug has ever used, whether it's
    networking providers, datacenter providers, software,
    servers, storage, or even people, has let us down at one
    point or another. It's the name of the game, and our job is
    to handle these problems and outages as best we can. 
 ===

	http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-9995301-93.html

( I am a smugmug client, and my site is down at the moment as well;
even the outage.mg page took over 30s to load.  The associated SmugBlog
posting with some more details is here:

Hello,

 

I am getting a lot of complaints from customers from Tiscali UK who are

A colleague down in Huntington Beach tells me it was strong enough
to knock over some furniture at his place.

Also, a few minor aftershocks:

Family in the area report "quite a jolt" and that the phones were out

Message-ID: <20080731111044.4D38D215@resin15.mta.everyone.net>




Did anyone notice any Sprintlink or Qwest problems prior to 07:30 GMT today?  I see that about 250-300 Mbps shifted from Sprint to Qwest at 07:30 GMT.  This is not normal for us.  It would appear to be logically close to Hawaii (for example, US West Coast) but, I believe, not here as there is nothing in my router logs.

I haven't been able to get www.networksolutions.com or www.netsol.com
to come up in a browser from the UK since I first tried about 6 
hours ago.

Here is a news flash for you.

Several sites now block (or refuse to react to) pings and route traces.

This has the effect making attempts at those things and reporting 
failures noise at best and abuse at worst.

According to an ICQ.com forum thread, linked to by Slashdot, ICQ has
reportedly started blocking third-party chat clients, such as pidgin.

Users receive a message telling them their "client version is too old".

No further to date.

I think this only has to do with the version of ICQ the client emulates. 
For example Adium version 1.2.5 emulates a version that is actually too 
old and will not work.  So I updated to 1.2.6 which was released yesterday 
(YMMV) and was able to login without any issues.  I think there is also an 
older Adium client that works maybe 1.12 or so.  Also, is this really an 
outage??

I don't think ICQ is blocking anything, because I'm connected from  
Adium and it redirects me to the Pidgin website to get a "new version"  
of the software.  I think it's more of a need for the IM client guys  
to update their crap to the newer ICQ protocol version.

I would think that anything that causes end users to call the support desk because they can't connect is considered an "outage".

No, not any more.  I used to have one, but that webserver crashed hard.

Wiki's are good for *knowledge capture*; they're not really much more
than a glorified, searchable scratch pad.  They, notably, are *not* a
database, a spreadsheet, a mailing list, a newsgroup, or a ticket
tracking system...

Honestly, probably the *best* thing to do is to make
outages-announce at outages.org be an *OTRS Instance*.  New announcements
will start tickets.  Comments on old ones will go the right place.

People who want to see status can monitor the OTRS.  People who want
announcements can subscribe to the list.

Yes, RT would probably work just as well...

Cheers,

Specfically: IRC is bad for this because it *does not leave tracks*
(well, without help).

The tracks are very important.

Are we archiving now at puck?

Ok, I'll expand and formalize my suggestion.

I think that the best approach to this would be to set up an OTRS (or RT)
install which receives the mail for outages@, and which automatically
subscribes all tickets to outages-notify@ *and* outages-discuss at .

The Mailman instance can then handle outages-notify (a broadcast list
which only the OTRS can post to) and outages-discuss, a general
subscription list, where everyone can talk about the tickets, but OTRS
won't hear it.

Users who only want notices subscribe to -notify, users who like the
chat subscribe to -discuss, people who have actual content to
contribute about the outage (which we can all hash out what we mean
by), can actually reply to the OTRS postings to -notify (which must
not mung Reply-To), and those posts will go on the ticket and also to
the two lists.

How's that sound, folks?

Wondering if anyone else is seeing similar problems, or if anyone knows of
any widespread problems with Internap/XO/Savvis that I can pass on to my
customer to let them know what's going on.

Thanks,

Don't know what the issues are, but the gist from tech support is
"Eastern Australia can't connect".

Savvis case number is 1336683, no ETA yet, but engineers are on it.
Savvis confirmed that it is a connectivity issue to Asia/Pac region.

About 20 minutes after I posted the above info, it was back up.  From
the outside, it looks like they routed around it:

Router: Ivenue bgp1

I'm sure Jared can, if he has the time.  I installed OTRS and it was a
walk-on, though I'm sort of stalled figuring out how best to design my
queue structure for my shop...

I know several list members have already offered to donate time and
hardware to the project. I believe all that is pending is a consensus as
to whether it is valuable to the list as a whole.

Message-ID: <20080703155839.GA3483@cgi.jachomes.com>

Let me un-thread this, so no one misses it.

It has been proposed (by me :-) that we actually set up a ticket
tracker for keeping tabs on outages, with companion -notify and
-discuss mailing lists, as below.

Opinions on this idea, and volunteers to set it up or host it are

Ok, I'll expand and formalize my suggestion.

I think that the best approach to this would be to set up an OTRS (or RT)
install which receives the mail for outages@, and which automatically
subscribes all tickets to outages-notify@ *and* outages-discuss at .

The Mailman instance can then handle outages-notify (a broadcast list
which only the OTRS can post to) and outages-discuss, a general
subscription list, where everyone can talk about the tickets, but OTRS
won't hear it.

Users who only want notices subscribe to -notify, users who like the
chat subscribe to -discuss, people who have actual content to
contribute about the outage (which we can all hash out what we mean
by), can actually reply to the OTRS postings to -notify (which must
not mung Reply-To), and those posts will go on the ticket and also to
the two lists.

How's that sound, folks?

I am in support of this idea for the following reason:

There has been a small history of what I will call marginally on topic.
These discussions, though somewhat interesting, don't accomplish much more
than to raise my--already heavy--email load.  With a ticketing system and
companion -notify list this would not be an issue.

The valid scope of what belongs on the list is clearly a matter of
consensus/opinion and will likely never be satisfactorily addressed for
everyone.  With a ticketing system, outages that are in-scope may be
subscribed to, with discussion taking place in the comments while those
that are out of scope are only a single notification and much less of a
bother.

Note: I'm familiar primarily with Bugzilla, but I can only assume that
OTRS and RT have similar subscription/commenting features.

Thanks,

~JasonG

Well, my initial approach was to add the notify list to each ticket, so
that all comments added to the actual ticket would go to notify.

It sounds like you are suggesting that *only the initial Ticket Open
message* go to notify, and anyone who wants to know about specific
tickets can log into OTRS, and add themseves to that ticket, do I have
that right?

Me personally, I'm the sort of person who might want to see *all*
ticket traffic on my blackberry, instead of only the Open messages...

but it's possible that this could be handled by OTRS itself; as a
signed-up user, I could watch the queue in question, and let that
mechanism send me the messages, while -notify only got the initial
Ticket Open messages.  I have to go check the manual, I'm not a wizard
on OTRS yet.

Cheers,

Sounds reasonable. I'd send the -discuss messages to an mbox
to read 'whenever' and could leave the -notify ones in my high
priority inbox. Looks like a win to me.

My experience of RT is that it doesn't handle well any situation that
can't be described as "Internal ticketing for my department in my
company" -- in particular, I tried to find a way to use it in the
consulting business I worked for, and it didn't have enough degrees of
freedom to get the work done... at least, without integrating Asset
Tracker, and defining each customer as an Asset, which was a bit too
icky for me.

It *appears* OTRS would handle that better, but I can't be sure, since
I'm not done deploying it myself.  Anyone who has OTRS or RT gurus
laying about; point them at this thread.

Cheers,

I know you can be a "Watcher" in RT, which allows you to follow all the
comments/replies on a given queue.

In general, I have had a better experience with RT than OTRS, btw, but I
do not want to start a flamewar around that, you guys choose whatever
you want (or rather, the person/org hosting/managing the service should
get to choose, obviously).

Greetings,

Come monday (7/7) we will be making final transition for the mailing
list to the new domain (outages.org).

With this change we will be splitting the list into 2 sub-list:

outages at outages.org - outages reporting/alerts.
announce at outages.org - notifications related to wiki (coming soon),
change management, future updates, etc.

We will continue to monitor the list further and see if it warrants
'outages-discuss' for any post outages meta-discussion (troubleshooting,
analysis, post-mortem, etc) so it can help alleviate noise and keep
outages reporting brief and to the point.


Let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks for listening/feedback.


regards,
/virendra

There is a power outage in downtown Vancouver, and apparently Peer1's
UPS and/or Generators have failed.

UPDATE
by cpugsley on Mon Jul 14, 2008 10:10 am

Upon further review the power outage has affected the entire Financial
District. Generator 7 - the main generator in the Harbour Centre
building that powers PEER 1 and other business worked for
approximately 20 minutes after the power went out. The 16th floor data
center and the 21st floor West data center are currently at a 90%
power loss. The 21st floor North is now at 100% power loss. We've also
learned that the UPS power is affected as well.

The Harbour Centre building is working around the clock to restart the
generator as quickly as possible. We will continue to provide updates
as they are received.

Thank you for your continued patience.

Most buildings downtown are without power.  Our collocation facilities
are running on generator power at 200 granville street snf at 515
Hastings (adjacent to Harbour center) are online.  BCHydro does not
expect power to be restored untill at least 3PM PST.



Underground fire causing outage;

>From Canada.com -

http://communities.canada.com/theprovince/blogs/newsroom/default.aspx


The fire apparently started in an underground power vault, five feet
beneath the surface on Richards Street between Dunsmuir and Pender
Streets. The fire blew a manhole cover off.

Officials initially said they would let the fire burn itself out, as it
wasn't accessible. McKay said officials hope the fire hasn't spread, but
it's not clear yet.

Ironically, our gear in the UPS-cursed and outage-plagued Spencer 
building next door are running fine. I guess all that maintenance 
work Peer1's done over the past several months paid off this time? No 
way to know from where I sit in Seattle if the "entire Financial 
District" includes this building, or if they are properly on genset. 
We'll see.

Message-ID: <930913da0807161330x7fea75ecs26cef0157ba0f341@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone seeing/heard of any issues with AT&T, possibly in Atlanta?

We are on Charter (business cable) here in the office.  We keep losing
connectivity -- but traceroutes appear to die within att.net in Atlanta.
(Which to me would indicate a problem within AT&T somewhere, not our
connection.)

Also, I've spoken with someone who is using AT&T DSL (business) here in
town, and they are having similar problems getting to the 'net.

Sounds like something is up.  (And the weather IS nice for backhoe
activities...)

When you're having connectivity problems to a site, please at least
post its IP, if not example traces (I use 'mtr -R -C 10' for easier
readability)...

I can't conveniently switch to my other uplink because I'm on the machine
with mtr on it, and my mail session will die.  As you can see, I don't have
AT&T in my path, so the trace probably doesn't tell you much.

Except why I use mtr to post diagnostic traces.  :-)

Cheers,

Just a follow-up/resolution...

To make a long story short, I found out that Charter was having some
hardware issues upstream (on their port facing AT&T.)  Essentially, that
particular connection was flapping, causing all sorts of routing fun.

At the same time, there was some issue going on with AT&T's DSL -- which, as
far as I can tell, was completely unrelated to the Charter issue (other than
that they were happening at the same time.)

All is well now.  Gotta love networking!

     Cheers,
     Jeremy

There is a confirmed problem with an AboveNet fiber somewhere between 60 
Hudson in NYC and the Elmsford/White Plains (Westchester County) area. 
Is anyone else seeing the effects of this?

We saw the connection go down @ 09:14 eastern. It continues to be down 
at this time (15:34 eastern). We have heard that a fiber repair has been 
dispatched.

does the packet loss continue after those hops? or does it look like  
routers with icmp rate limiting where forwarded traffic on the data  
plane is okay?

Could go either way. My traces last night showed PL all the way to the 
target, and a lot of * / !H / destination unreachable. Tonight I still 
see PL starting at the same point (ae-93-93.csw4.Dallas1.Level3.net), 
but ICMP to the destination is making it through, and I'm not having 
connectivity problems anymore.

Something's still up in Dallas but it may be ICMP getting dropped on the 
floor. Not the norm, though, or at least it wasn't until lately ;)

Subject: [outages] CNet: Amazon S3 experiencing 'elevated error rates' Sunday
Message-ID: <20080721033015.GA17761@cgi.jachomes.com>

 ===
Amazon.com's Simple Storage Service--a major component of its
online computing services--is apparently experiencing problems
Sunday.

The e-tailer's "Service Health Dashboard" reports that the S3
service in both the United States and Europe is experiencing
"elevated error rates."

The outage is causing CenterNetworks images to break, the site
reports, and SmugMug reports that "a large portion of the
photos and videos stored" on S3 are currently offline.

SmugMug seemed sympathetic to Amazon's woes and offered this
advice:

    Every component SmugMug has ever used, whether it's
    networking providers, datacenter providers, software,
    servers, storage, or even people, has let us down at one
    point or another. It's the name of the game, and our job is
    to handle these problems and outages as best we can. 
 ===

	http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-9995301-93.html

( I am a smugmug client, and my site is down at the moment as well;
even the outage.mg page took over 30s to load.  The associated SmugBlog
posting with some more details is here:

A colleague down in Huntington Beach tells me it was strong enough
to knock over some furniture at his place.

Also, a few minor aftershocks:

Family in the area report "quite a jolt" and that the phones were out

Message-ID: <20080731111044.4D38D215@resin15.mta.everyone.net>




Did anyone notice any Sprintlink or Qwest problems prior to 07:30 GMT today?  I see that about 250-300 Mbps shifted from Sprint to Qwest at 07:30 GMT.  This is not normal for us.  It would appear to be logically close to Hawaii (for example, US West Coast) but, I believe, not here as there is nothing in my router logs.

I haven't been able to get www.networksolutions.com or www.netsol.com
to come up in a browser from the UK since I first tried about 6 
hours ago.

Seems IP specific to me.  www.networksolutions.com is fine.
www.netsol.com stalls.

Here is a news flash for you.

Several sites now block (or refuse to react to) pings and route traces.

This has the effect making attempts at those things and reporting 
failures noise at best and abuse at worst.
