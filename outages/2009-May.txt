It appears this outage was a result of a transformer failure within
their power distribution panel at their Alpharetta data center.


Root Cause:

Failure of a defective transformer in a UPS system B distribution panel
which resulted in a loss of power to certain critical system components
in the data center. Apparently the system did not automatically failover
 to the redundant system A power as designed because system A power
distribution panel breaker was left in a non-redundant state for some
unknown reason. Consequently it took down their core network down
including their mainframe / midrange systems.

I tried to send something to the good old inet-access mailing list
(@inet-acces.net) and the server (duct.tape.net) has been rejecting SMTP
connections for at least a day and a half.  Does anybody know if this is
a temporary thing, or has another old useful resource disappeared?

Dunno the answer to your question, but SPAM-L just signed off, NANOG is 
a hostile wasteland.

Maybe the time to sign off email has arrived.

I've hosted something called inet-ops at puck.nether.net which rarely if  
ever gets used.  Do not know if it would be of value to anyone.  The

Damn shame SPAM-L is about to be shut down. Seems the archives are going
away too and my personal store only goes back to March 2005. Lots of
usefulness in there in spite of the reasons specified for its demise.
It's also a shame that everything is offtopic on NANOG. The last thing I
got from inet-access was Nov. 15, 2008.

What exactly is left? Does anyone know? Not really interested in web
forums. Are there any worthwhile groups on usenet that aren't a spam
magnet? Maybe it's time to fire up an NNTP server.

It is down, "but coming back" according to Avi.

It's *always* time to fire up an NNTP server if a web forum is
the alternative.

I cheated, he is crashing at my place tonight so I didn't have to deal

Works here.

However, we are downstream of Level 3 / as3356.  I heard a rumor they  
ACL'ed queries from sources outside their downstream cone.

I should clarify they work fine sometimes, so they are not down, but

I can report that the 4.2.2.x DNS servers have been unreliable and
almost unusable for a few days from one location I maintain.  I'm
guessing they've grown tired of being the free-for-all recursive DNS
servers of choice.

I assume no one took the time to explain to you that using either
of the Level 3 public recursive nameservers for long-term use is
considered rude and can possibly get you blocked from using them?

Please consider running your own caching nameserver, use your uplink
provider's DNS servers, or both (caching nameserver + forwarders
feature).

Both 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 behave fine, tested from 4 different physical
locations (two regions in northern California, Arizona, and Virginia):

I have also been told that Level 3 was starting to ACL these off, so if your
connections are load balanced to where the route to these servers is
sometimes via Level 3 and sometimes not, that could be your issue.

Also while these servers have been around for some time and are great to use
in a pinch or for testing, they are not officially supported servers and are
not what Level 3 would ever give a direct customer to use, so you should
generally avoid using them for anything production, especially without other
resolvers in your list.

Based on some (relatively unscientific) experimentation, this does
appear to be true.  From sources that reach 4.2.2.1 via what appear to
be peering links (such as an XO / Level(3) interconnect) queries time
out, while sources that reach 4.2.2.1 via what appear to be transit
links have no problems with consistent resolution.

I can't really blame them, as a) open recursive DNS servers are rife for
DNS amplification abuse, and b) this must be an enormous resource
consumer for them.  Probably a boon for OpenDNS and any others in the
open/semi-open resolver space.

Regards,
Tim

Just to throw some unscientific information in the mix, I can query them 
from AS11170 downstream of Sprint (best path) and SAVVIS. Only did two 
queries though, so it's not a good reliability test. ;)

Configuring anycast isn't the easiest thing to do; if they're *not* 
"officially supported" even for L3 customers (which, happily, I am), then why
*do* the still operate them?  Cause they have the coolest IP addresses on 
the Internet?

Well, nowhere is it written that you can't anycast those particular 6 IPs to
*your own* network's resolver servers, is it now?  :-)

If by 'self inflicted' you mean "I used their resources without asking  
or permission, and now they took those resources away making me fail",  
then we agree.

BTW, setting up anycast NSes is trivial.  And Jay knows this. :)

I don't know, isn't it written somewhere "thou shalt not use my IP

L3 took a hint from Randy Bush and encourages their competitors to....

No, it's just too easy, like shooting fish in a barrel. ;)

Likewise.  Which of course affects the whole flipping world since everyone 
uses google analytics and stuff.

My path is also through level 3 - don't know if it's confined to them.

expect to resolve the problem. Please note that this resolution time is
an estimate and may change.

We've been noticing issues for the past hour accessing Google's sites.
Sluggish responses mostly.

Other sites are fine.  We connect through Level3 and Bell Canada.

There are some reports that it may actually be at AT&T outage.  The other possibility is that it hit only some Google data centers.  I never saw a problem here in Maryland.

FWIW, just had someone report they are unable to send E-Mail using Gmail
w/Thunderbird.  I investigated, discovered they cannot connect to
smtp.gmail.com (on either port 465 or 587).  This was using an AT&T DSL
connection near Atlanta, GA.  I am able to hit smtp.gmail.com from other
places just fine, though.

Possibly related?

Non - L3 paths show no issues (well, at least a few of my non-L3 google paths show no issues.)

We can't reach Google services from our level3 connection (T3) or our
Verizon Connection (50 Mbits)  Works fine from our Comcast Fiber and
from my home Comcast Cable modem even though it routes through Level 3.

Same here.

We tested through Level3 and through TransitRail.

I called the Google NOC and they told me they were having a problem,
but they didn't elaborate.

Is anyone aware of any Level3 or Google outages in the NY area?   We have had to move our Google/Youtube traffic away from L3 this morning.

No complaints here. GMail, Google search, Maps, etc are all very snappy.

I happened to have a traceroute to www.google.com at around 08:14 PDT.
It seems like we started seeing trouble on the boundary of AT&T and
Google. The traceroute originated from San Mateo, CA.

I called Level 3 and they wouldn't provide or did not have a master 
ticket on it but they did confirm there was a 'major' outage but nothing 
more unfortunately.

That's what I know.

Seems fine from other carriers -> google.

Robert, I live in Delaware, and I was out of service.
I don't think this was a network issue, (I have unconfirmed reports that say
it wasn't), and was on Google's infrastructure.  I think if you were
affected, it depended on what Google data center you were connected to.

Any RIM or VZW contacts on this list?  Ping me offline; I'm having some odd 
troubles getting forwarded mail into blackberry.net, and the postmaster@
address *also* bounces, which is awfully stylish, and the tech support
department wants to charge me to tell them their mail system is broken...
which dog won't hunt.

Have 12 other subs working fine in the same setup, including one on VZW...

Subject: [outages] Long latency in receiving email on this list/Other
	observations about today's Google Incident
Message-ID: <15BDDC14871D2A49BFCEEEF409EB29830874B223@exchange.syssrcad.syssrc.com>

I am looking through the emails from the outages list from today's
Google incident and many of the posts have original time stamps.  I
received my copies of mailing lists posts over an hour after they were
sent.  For example, I posted a message today at 12:11PM EDT, and I
received my copy from the list at 1:20PM.  We were well into our
troubleshooting with Verizon and Level 3 when I saw the first post on
this list.  Is there anything we can do to speed the delivery of the
emails from this list?   We have had a better incident response had we
known sooner that this was a global issue.  And I was still receiving
hour old trouble reports long after the problem was resolved.

 

I also called two out of three of our upstream providers (Level 3 and
Verizon)  Neither had status messages on their web sites, nor for their
dispatch folks.  We had all of the relevant information (account #,
Circuit ID etc) but they insisted on going through a long ticket process
(Have you verified power, what are your IPS, what IPs are you trying to
reach, what are your contact hours, what type of equipment do you have
etc) instead of just taking the call.  At Verizon, (50 Mbit circuit) I
was on hold for about 15 minutes before I was even able to place a
trouble ticket.

 

I also saw speculation on the list that it was a Level 3 problem, and in
fact we could not reach Google with any reliability on our DS3 with
Level3 (On level3 IP Space)  But our Comcast line uses Level 3 for
transport and we had no issues reaching Google services from Comcast.

I wouldn't fault any them for going through the long process since the
problem was purely a Google issue. Why would their dispatch folks even
care? Why would they put status messages up just because Google fails?
It's not like this is the first time it's ever happened, and it will
happen again. It's sad we assume that Google is a non-fault entity and
that it must be our transit providers.

As far as deliveries, yeah, I notice some posts to the list show up
hours later than others. Never tried to gather any data about it, though.

Forgive me if this seems like plugging, I am just passing information,
sorry.
Yesterday, when it all happened, we covered it in realtime at the Internet
Storm Center at http://isc.sans.org.  As Gmail was down, Email may not have
been a good way to pass information, for instance yesterday, I used a
combination of the website and Twitter.  This turned out to be extremely
effective as we were able to isolate exactly where the outages were, who was
working, who wasn't working, and we were able to pass the reason for the
outage to our readers about an hour before Google said anything.  It was a
wild rollercoaster, as the tweets came in about 50 at a time, resulting in
many hundreds (if not over a thousand) tweets -- and sources of information.

When I saw this topic come up, I chuckled to my self: "yaknow, it was 
not that long ago that we marveled that I could get an email from 
Sausalito to College Park and an answer back in less time than the same 
messages would take by US Mail."

My read was just that he included the traceroute so the OP could see the
route in question, not that he was holding it up as an example of the problem.

Seems sensible to me, though he could have been more explicit.

I cannot seem to make or receive calls to/from any at&t cell phone in

We get outsourced telephone service from Telovations in Tampa, and at 0950EDT
today, they had *something* break.  Since I can still get to my voicemail
boxes from outside the building, I assume it's their data service to customer
sites, and not the voice service into them.

Since it's multiple sites, I assume it's some aggregated data facility of DS-3
level or higher.  I don't know if they get it directly from Verizon or from
some reseller -- though since it's clear-channel data, maybe not.

Anyone in Tampa heard anything today?  It appears to still be down now, an
hour later.

Cheers,
-- jra

Jay,

We lost a connection to one of our upstream providers. This then turned in to a BGP propagation problem on the back-up. We lost a few subnets because the advertising was not working for 3 subnets. All is resolved now.

Subject: [outages] AT&T data outage (05/29/2009)
Message-ID: <4A1FFA79.5050505@visp.net>

Currently experiencing an outage on the AT&T cellular data network (both
3G and EDGE) on southern Oregon.  Reports from various friends say it's
also down in eastern Oregon, western Washington, and southern and
northern California.  Getting assigned IPs via DHCP, but no connectivity
beyond what appears to be the access edge.  AT&T tells me that they have
a "massive outage" going on right now, no ETR.

AT&T wireless in Phoenix is also affected. The phones I've tested all think they have a connection but can't get any data.

Voice service, even on the 3G network, seems not to be affected.

I'm on AT&T here in sillicon valley, and my iPhone isn't having issues  
on 3G. I know this connects differently than other phones with the  
MediaNet plans, could that be a factor?
