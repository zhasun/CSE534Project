We?re seeing some stuff down from Level 3 and Zayo in the Herndon/Ashburn area.

No confirmation from anyone about where the physical problem is yet.

Zayo says they have an OC-192 down which happens to be affecting a
couple of our fiber paths.  Tech should be on site by now but no
official ETR yet.

Our Abovenet circuit in Reston, VA is down but I'm told it is a cut near
Loudon County Parkway and the WO & D trail. That would be near the Equinix
complex in Ashburn

However we're seeing higher latency on Cogent as well.

My question is, are there two outages one in DC on M St and one in Ashburn?

Looks like drilling damage to some fiber.

"Third Party Construction Bi-Directional drilling impacted our cable.
Construction crews are 30 minutes out. Zayo
OSP PM are on site at this time."

Nothing to do but wait for the repairs.

Just got an update that they have re-spliced the last of the 36 cables and are going to begin closing things up out there. Took them until about 2am to get the cable exposed as apparently it was under the parkway and had been damaged pretty heavily by the drill. The whole section needed to be replaced. We've been looking good here for a few hours.

"Dear Valued Zayo Customer, There are 36 ribbons on this fiber.Ribbons 34,35,36 are complete (note Ribbon 34 had light on a fiber pair so it was restored as well). All ribbons with customer traffic per the VA-B27 Impact report have been completed. The ETR is within the hour. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience."

The follow up, it looks like they introduced a routing loop to the network and that is what took everything down.

Yeah, however some of their sites are up. Here are some you can try:

Working fine on Comcast in the SF Bay Area.

Strangely, juniper.net redirects to https://www.juniper.net  (note the
https), however www.juniper.net does NOT redirect to https...

For me it fails on both a WiFi hotspot and VZW 4G from the phone, but
it works from both lynx and elinks on a remote server via ConnectBot
SSH.  I'm not at a desktop to try a regular desktop browser, but it
does also fail with "request desktop site" on Chrome.

These all fail:

http://www.juniper.net
https://www.juniper.net
http://juniper.net
https://juniper.net

The SSL ones return a "this cert is not signed by a trusted CA"

This works:

http://www.juniper.net/us/en

which redirects to the mobile site on m.juniper.net.

If I go directly to https://juniper.net I get a certificate warning. Chrome
complains that the certificate is issued by an unknown authority (Juniper's
own CA). It doesn't redirect to https://www.juniper.net/us/en/ for me.
Either http://juniper.net or http(s)://www.juniper.net works fine and
properly redirects.

Looks like they didn't get the proper CA for that one particular case.

This is with Chrome coming from AT&T in Southern California.

Indeed -- this works for me:

...but this does not:

Testing in a browser (Firefox) for https://juniper.net/ results in this:

juniper.net uses an invalid security certificate.
The certificate is not trusted because no issuer chain was provided.
(Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)

http://superuser.com/questions/452063/the-certificate-is-not-trusted-because-no-issuer-chain-was-provided

Usually this indicates that someone rolled out a SSL certificate without
either a) including the full CA chain (how to do this varies per
webserver), or b) did not include the full CA chain within the
certificate itself.  It often has to do with a missing root CA.

However, in the below output, I see mention of "Juniper Networks Root
CA", which implies Juniper is self-signing their certs rather than
getting them signed by an actual CA?  If so, that's pretty disgraceful.
Not that I have a problem with self-signed certs, but it's extremely
rude in this particular case, given Juniper's role.

Any errors below that say "unable to get local issuer certificate" are
issues on my side, not Juniper's.

Hi,

Jeremy noted:

#Testing in a browser (Firefox) for https://juniper.net/ results in this:
#
#juniper.net uses an invalid security certificate.
#The certificate is not trusted because no issuer chain was provided.
#(Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)

There are issues with more than just the cert. A more extensive analysis 
can be seen at:

https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=juniper.net

[FWIW, the SSL Labs tester is a tool I've previously recommended to folks 
in the higher ed community, e.g., as part of "SSL/TLS Certificiates: 
Giving Your Use of Server Certificates a Hard Look,"
http://pages.uoregon.edu/joe/hardlook/hard-look.pdf and most recently in 
"Networking in These Crazy Days: Stay Calm, Get Secure, Get Involved,"
http://pages.uoregon.edu/joe/merit-networking/merit-networking.pdf at
slide 104. If you haven't checked your own site and critical sites you
rely on, it can be eye opening to do so.]

Regards,

Joe

I wasn't aware of this site/tool; this could have saved me a lot of pain
some years ago.

Huge thumbs up -- thanks for the tip, Joe!

Right they made this mistake with that particular URL only. I emailed a
contact there. I'm sure it will be fixed shortly. All other url variants
redirect to the https://www pattern which has a proper CA

I think this is a separate issue from the 404 error though.  I can't
load ANY of the variants, SSL or not, using a mobile device connected
to the same network where I can successfully load the site using a
desktop system.

Hah yeah you're quite right Chuck.

Works fine on my laptop but then when I switch to my phone (on the same
wifi network) I get the 404.

Must be attempting to redirect to a non-existent mobile version of
http://juniper.net?

There have been httpv6 issues since 7:30 pm (Central) last night, too. I
informed my contacts there this morning. I'll let them know about this, too.

Using both Chrome and Firefox on my Android phone, I'm getting 404 for

FYI - GTT (previously Tinet) has been experiencing a very severe (their NOC's words) DDOS attack in Dallas on their network. Their engineering has been attempting to identify the traffic and block it. This began around 2:41PM CST -0600, at least from my point of view where it was affecting a circuit I have from Dallas to LA and is still affecting it as of this writing. Lots of packet loss and latency observed.

GTT resolved my service issues being caused by this about 30 minutes ago, however I do not know if they resolved the actual attack traffic. I know they rerouted my circuit.

Juniper shared with me a few minutes ago that "one of the web servers
filesystem went into a read-only, so we have removed that server from the
cluster."  That resolved the HTTPv6 around 9:45 pm Central and
http://www.juniper.net now loads without issue on smartphones.  The cert
issue from smartphones when visiting https://juniper.net remains.  That
issue has probably been there for a long time.

Yes, Jeremy Chadwick mentioned that yesterday afternoon. =)

Juniper followed up with me on that, too, and they're going to replace that
self-signed certificate with a proper one.

Juniper informed me overnight that they replaced their updated cert for

 today (OC192 fiber kink/cut on riverbank)
Message-ID: <7D1B71C4CB3D0040A553783182CAB5795C1FA4@CLE-EX-MBX1.telsource.net>

Basically a repeat from 12-30-2013.  They are just going to roll a new bundle today to restore service.  It "feels" like -40 out there, so hard to say how long this is going to take given the conditions.

Latest update:

01/06/2014,09:29:33:[AT&T ]
Activity Type Code Desc: PROGRESS COMMENTS
Activity Type Code: PROG
Windstream has 2 technicians at the Wisconsin River office and 1 technician dispatched to the Platteville, WI office with an estimated time of arrival of 9:45 CT. Their current plan is for the Windstream technicians along with their engineering team to roll fibers to restore service. There is no ETTR at this time.

Hopefully this will be the long term fix.

Windstream has identified 2 frozen splice cases that need to be defrosted with heaters to restore service. There is no ETTR at this time.

I'm not on Comcast, so I can't provide a direct confirmation
of this, but there are multiple reports on Twitter of Comcast
partial outages in the Ann Arbor area. The typical report is
that some TV channels work, others don't, and that Internet
is out.

I'll update if I get more useful details.

I am using Comcast in the municipality to the immediate east of Ann Arbor
(Ypsilanti Township) and I am up and running on my usual configuration;
four downstream QAM256 channels, two upstream QAM64 channels, and an
upstream QAM16 channel.

Cheers,
Rusty

We have a fiber connection into them in Troy (outside Detroit) and we seem to be having some intermittent issues but we haven't localized it yet.

Note that there was a *lot* of snowfall in the area over the past 24 hours and now its very cold and windy so this might be weather related.

Some more info:

At approx 8:12pm eastern we show an event on one of our Comcast Ethernet (layer2 network, not ip) endpoints having about 14 minutes of outage. The customer affected is in flint. None of our other endpoints showed any alarms.

We show no events and normal traffic and bgp prefix counts on our ip handoff to them in Troy.

I don't have any telemetry from cable modems in the area since we only use Comcast for commercial-type services.

Looks like my connection is being routed to Ashburn, San Jose and then back to Chicago. I heard they may have down fiber from Detroit to Chicago and are routing traffic around it.

I'm not on Comcast, so I can't provide a direct confirmation

of this, but there are multiple reports on Twitter of Comcast

partial outages in the Ann Arbor area. The typical report is

that some TV channels work, others don't, and that Internet

is out.?

I'll update if I get more useful details.

Comcast NOC told me here is "something pretty major" going on in Chicago related to some fiber outages. There is a fiber issue in Detroit too. Their engineers were tied up and that's all I got -- they're supposed to call back within an hour with an update.

 today (OC192 fiber kink/cut on riverbank)

This is still down as of today.  Latest update.

01/07/2014,10:31:30:[AT&T ]
Activity Type Code Desc: PROGRESS COMMENTS
Activity Type Code: PROG
Windstream has restored the system in one direction by rolling the system to the best available fibers between Genoa and Wisconsin River, WI. Due to excessive loss on the fiber spans because of the cold temperatures last night, it was determined by Field Operations that it was not safe to have splicers working on the poles. For today, the splicing contractor will go to two identified splice cases to investigate a possible ice intrusion, and an FDP panel will be replaced in Genoa pending MOP approval. Fiber testing will also take place between Coon Valley and Genoa, and also from Wisconsin River to Platteville. Service may experience intermittent trouble and is being monitored. There is no ETTR at this time.

Windstream is still attempting to restore service.  After the initial fiber run, they found an additional break in the line.  Latest update:

01/06/2014,14:48:03:[AT&T ]
Activity Type Code Desc: PROGRESS COMMENTS
Activity Type Code: PROG
Windstream has identified 2 frozen splice cases that need to be defrosted with heaters to restore service. There is no ETTR at this time.

Basically a repeat from 12-30-2013.  They are just going to roll a new bundle today to restore service.  It "feels" like -40 out there, so hard to say how long this is going to take given the conditions.

Latest update:
01/06/2014,09:29:33:[AT&T ]
Activity Type Code Desc: PROGRESS COMMENTS
Activity Type Code: PROG
Windstream has 2 technicians at the Wisconsin River office and 1 technician dispatched to the Platteville, WI office with an estimated time of arrival of 9:45 CT. Their current plan is for the Windstream technicians along with their engineering team to roll fibers to restore service. There is no ETTR at this time.

Hopefully this will be the long term fix.

Not seeing the XO/Denver packet loss any more.  Looks like the XO within XO changed for me and the end to end loss is gone.

Activity Type Code Desc: PROGRESS COMMENTS
Activity Type Code: PROG
Windstream is continuing to work the plan of action that they outlined earlier today. Plan updates are as follows:1.Technicians continue to investigate possible ice intrusion in splice cases. This work is in progress. The first splice case was found to be in good condition. Technicians are en-route to the 2nd splice case. 2.Complete the fiber distribution panel (FDP) replacement in Genoa, WI. This is expected to improve the span signal loss by 3 Db. 3.The fiber between the Coon Valley central office and the Genoa central office will to be tested.  There is considerably higher signal loss in one direction (up to 6 dB of additional loss). The technicians will perform testing after the second splice case inspection/resolution.There is no ETTR at this time.

This is still down as of today.  Latest update.

01/07/2014,10:31:30:[AT&T ]
Activity Type Code Desc: PROGRESS COMMENTS
Activity Type Code: PROG
Windstream has restored the system in one direction by rolling the system to the best available fibers between Genoa and Wisconsin River, WI. Due to excessive loss on the fiber spans because of the cold temperatures last night, it was determined by Field Operations that it was not safe to have splicers working on the poles. For today, the splicing contractor will go to two identified splice cases to investigate a possible ice intrusion, and an FDP panel will be replaced in Genoa pending MOP approval. Fiber testing will also take place between Coon Valley and Genoa, and also from Wisconsin River to Platteville. Service may experience intermittent trouble and is being monitored. There is no ETTR at this time.

Windstream is still attempting to restore service.  After the initial fiber run, they found an additional break in the line.  Latest update:

01/06/2014,14:48:03:[AT&T ]
Activity Type Code Desc: PROGRESS COMMENTS
Activity Type Code: PROG
Windstream has identified 2 frozen splice cases that need to be defrosted with heaters to restore service. There is no ETTR at this time.

Basically a repeat from 12-30-2013.  They are just going to roll a new bundle today to restore service.  It "feels" like -40 out there, so hard to say how long this is going to take given the conditions.

Latest update:
01/06/2014,09:29:33:[AT&T ]
Activity Type Code Desc: PROGRESS COMMENTS
Activity Type Code: PROG
Windstream has 2 technicians at the Wisconsin River office and 1 technician dispatched to the Platteville, WI office with an estimated time of arrival of 9:45 CT. Their current plan is for the Windstream technicians along with their engineering team to roll fibers to restore service. There is no ETTR at this time.

Hopefully this will be the long term fix.

Is anyone else experiencing issues with Telus subscribers? All of my
traceroutes to their subscriber IP's are dying in Seattle, regardless of
geographic area (west coast, east coast, Texas), and regardless of provider
(NTT, GTT, Cogent, HE, Comcast).

TIA.

Thanks for the response Josh. I was initially seeing traffic die at Telus'
first hop after anything in Seattle, but it appears to be working fine now.
Thanks!

Some people are able to reach it, but I just talked to one of their staff, who said:  ?We?re experiencing a site wide network issue, including the api servers?

www.dropbox.com is now redirecting to https://status.dropbox.com which
reports that it's down and they are working on it.

Not surprisingly, www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com says it's up (which, from
a simple website perspective, it is)

Twitter are now stating "We are aware of an issue currently affecting the
Dropbox site. We have identified the cause, which was the result of an
issue that arose during routine internal maintenance, and are working to
fix this as soon as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience."

@1775Sec claim to have release a partial user list from their "hack",
however the list appears to be one that's been floating around for over a
month so almost certainly isn't legitimate.

This had wide impact, including MPLS customers and Internet service across
the globe.

Our alerts started around 03:00 ET and the last issue cleared shortly
before 09:00 AM ET today. AT&T stated a 3 hour outage window with no
official rfo yet.

The numbers I saw stated over 400 routers were rebooted to recover.

I?m unable to resolve www.adafruit.com at the moment and from a quick poking around with dig, it looks like the glue records for ns1 and ns2.ladyada.net are missing.

I have no idea how to contact the Adafruit people outside of the internet, so if anyone on this list has such contact information, and advisory to them would be appreciated.

We're seeing an Dash (Bandwidth/Inetwork) voice termination outage, and are getting rejected with a 503 error. 

Is anyone else seeing this and have they heard more information about the cause and ETR?

Same here.

We?ve only seen it with termination traffic but of course we wouldn?t necessarily see it for origination if the calls just never get here.

Are anyone else's Level 3 IP circuits down in Ashburn? We lost a 10g
circuit about 90 minutes ago. Their support is being extra generic and
calling this a "known outage" with no additional details. It looks like a
possible equipment outage or fiber cut on the Equinix campus, as our
circuit between DC5 and DC2 is physically down (no light).

Is anyone else seeing anything similar?

Message-ID: <12389949.4016.1389931107242.JavaMail.root@benjamin.baylink.com>

A CPE NTP reflection attack this month has raised the profile, once again,
of the 14 year old and still mostly unimplemented BCP38, which would likely
have helped mitigate that attack, and certainly would mitigate others.

If you want to know more about BCP38 and how to implement it in your
networks -- or if you know *lots* about BCP38, and want to contribute to 
educating others about how to implement it in theirs -- we invite you 
to come visit

  http://www.bcp38.info

This has been a recorded public service announcement.

(Discussion to outages-discuss, please)

Subject: [outages] Two of www.ebay.com's six IPs timing out on HTTPv4 request
Message-ID: <000501cf1803$4b48bb60$e1da3220$@iname.com>

Our monitoring system reported errors with HTTPv4 requests around 11 pm
Central.  

www.ebay.com has six IPs for me:

C:\bin>dig A www.ebay.com +short
www.g.ebay.com.
66.135.200.181
66.135.210.61
66.135.210.181
66.211.181.161
66.211.181.181
66.135.200.161

Testing showed that queries to the other four work well, but 66.135.200.181
and 66.211.181.181 time out for me.

I used NAGIOS' check_http and httping to check, as I can specify the target
IP and it queries the whole page, not just the head.  Anyone else seeing
this?

I guess I should have read this first:

In English: I have no trouble getting back HTTP content from any of
those IPs, and promptly.

Source IP is 76.102.14.35, located in Mountain View, CA.

Given the volume, intensity, and duration of the "systemd is the worst 
designed anti-Unix-Philosophy POS ever and I want to do things to Lennart 
that would probably get me arrested" rant I just finished with, I can't 
decide whether to laugh or cry at that pipeline...

Thanks for that nice script.  I ran it myself (adding the timeout option
because it wasn't ever dying).  It's still out for me:

nagios:/home/fbulk# for i in `dig a www.ebay.com +short | grep -v www` ; do
printf "%-32s%-20s" "`date`" "$i" ; curl -i -s -m 15 -S -H "Host:
www.ebay.com" http://$i/ >/dev/null ; echo $? ; done
Thu Jan 23 06:09:13 CST 2014    66.135.210.61       0
Thu Jan 23 06:09:14 CST 2014    66.135.210.181      0
Thu Jan 23 06:09:15 CST 2014    66.211.181.161      0
Thu Jan 23 06:09:15 CST 2014    66.211.181.181      curl: (28) Operation
timed out after 15001 milliseconds with 0 bytes received 28
Thu Jan 23 06:09:30 CST 2014    66.135.200.161      0
Thu Jan 23 06:09:31 CST 2014    66.135.200.181      curl: (28) Operation
timed out after 15001 milliseconds with 0 bytes received 28
nagios:/home/fbulk#

But the two that fail do have port 80 open for me -- tcping and
tcptraceroute confirm that.  They're just not sending back any HTTP info.
I've tested from 96.31.0.5 and 199.120.69.4.

Frank

In English: I have no trouble getting back HTTP content from any of
those IPs, and promptly.

Source IP is 76.102.14.35, located in Mountain View, CA.

Subject: [outages] AS3257 GTT latency/packet loss issues between Stockholm
	and Frankfurt
Message-ID: <52E114F4.1030507@fud.no>

I first reported this to inoc at gt-t.net, but they refused to look into
it, as I'm not a customer of theirs. (An attitude which makes me very
happy I'm not, incidentally.). So I'll dump the info here in case
someone a more senior techie in GTT is reading this list and would like
to take a closer look.

Traffic from GTT's Stockholm PoP (in my case delivered to them there by
AS3549 to 77.67.82.145 a.k.a xe-5-2-0.stk30.ip4.tinet.net) destined
to/past their Frankfurt PoP gets either routed to 141.136.107.218
(ae5.fra61.ip4.tinet.net) or 89.149.185.105
(xe-5-0-1.fra61.ip4.tinet.net). It appears they're using ECMP between
these two links, as I can "choose" by slightly modifying the source
and/or destination address when I'm tracing (even though the addresses
remain within the same DFZ prefix).

When the path to 141.136.107.218 is chosen, the RTT increases by ~100ms
and there is significant packet loss. See below traceroutes, which are
done at the same time from the same source.

The return path is known to be good. If I change my outbound path to
the destinations I'm tracing to below in AS12741 to go via AS3356->AS174,
the problem immediately disappears. So for now I'm strong depreffing all
as-paths matching .*3257.* and I'm happy, but I'm thinking someone else
might be interested in looking into this...

Good path (xe-5-2-0.stk30. -> xe-5-0-1.fra61.ip4.tinet.net):

Same here.  We have four circuits located in NJ and PA that are experiencing severe packet loss, making them useless.

Looks like this might be isolated to CL's MPLS network, as our IP transit circuits are also not affected by this outage.  Perhaps someone made a boo-boo while making a change?...

We also lost our layer 3 MPLS connections between our San Francisco and New
York city offices.  New York City has the "Enhanced IQ" service (CTL will
send to the internet if destination is not an announced prefix from us)
 and that doesn't seem to be working very well either.

We were seeing DIA part of Enhanced ports come back up, but we weren't
getting routes from the CUGs/VRFs. Looks like BGP session had gone stale.
Kicked them all and we're back.

We lost a full cabinet (with dual electric feed) at 1250 Rene-Levesque, Montreal, QC Canada. A lot of carriers are present at that datacenter, Level3, Cogent, Hibernia, etc..

Just received this email from Cologix support:

"Hello, 
 
Please be advised that Cologix is experiencing a commercial power issue at our Cologix 3, 1250 Ren? Levesque datacenter. 
Our technicians are informed and working on repairing the problem. An update will be provided to you in the next 30 minutes.

Below is what we got.
Last night from around 11:30pm until 2:30am<x-apple-data-detectors://0> there was a widespread outage on the MPLS backbone that impacted customers coast to coast. Tier 3 rebooted 125+ routers throughout the network to restore service, though a handful of customers may have taken slightly longer. The issue has been escalated  and engineering is continuing to work to find out what caused the problem. As of now the network is stable, unfortunately I don't have much more info at this time to share.

We were seeing DIA part of Enhanced ports come back up, but we weren't getting routes from the CUGs/VRFs. Looks like BGP session had gone stale. Kicked them all and we're back.

We're in C3 with a couple of cabinets and aren't seeing any issues with our equipment or our waves out of 1250.  We're on their DC grid though, not sure exactly where my wave providers are located, however.

FYI: My QIX link is still up too.

We're on the AC grid, that's why.

Non-official RFO: someone pulled the unidentified emergency lever in the basement shutting down the AC feeds of the whole 5th floor.

Reminds me of a case back in '98 where the cleaners hung their heavy winter jackets on the emergency lever for the mains in our suite.

Trying to get to Gmail on my oldest account resulted in a 502.

Google Apps For Your Domain (free Gmail on a custom domain) got a 500, and my other regular Gmail account got a 500 as well.

Any enterprise Google Apps customers unable to get to mail?

IMAP poll from K9 on my Sprint 4G phone timed out.  Twice.

Logging in from web browser on tethered Linux laptop gives the login 
page ok, and correctly bounces a bad password, but the proper password
gives:

"""
500. That?s an error.

There was an error. Please try again later. That?s all we know.
"""

While Youtube already thought I was logged in, attempting to pop the 
menu to log out and check there also timed out; this may not just be
Gmail, either.

Yup; this looks like a problem.

Cheers,

We're investigating reports of an issue with Gmail. We will provide more 
information shortly.


I get an error #793 when I try and access in a browser and have a number of 
customers that use Google Apps that are getting:



	*Temporary Error (500)* 	

	


We're sorry, but your Gmail account is temporarily unavailable. We apologize 
for the inconvenience and suggest trying again in a few minutes. You can 
view theApps Status Dashboard <http://www.google.com/appsstatus>for the 
current status of the service.

My apologies for not checking the dateline; it's just been pointed out to
me that, even though Marketplace just posted that piece, the article is
about the August outage, not today.

The official report:

" Dear Valued Customers, 
 
During annual systems inspections an emergency power off (EPO) switch was inadvertently triggered.  
This switch, when triggered, shut down power to bus duct F.  (EPOs are designed to shut down all power, including utility and generator power, and, as a result, all power to bus duct F was shut down.)  The de-energizing of this bus duct removed power from multiple pieces of mechanical and electrical equipment, including a chiller and UPS2.  Customers supported by UPS2 experienced a 14 minute outage, after the UPS depleted its batteries (which provided 11 minutes and 57 seconds of run time).   Additionally, some customers saw higher temperatures in the data center. All power has been restored and all temperatures have returned to normal. 
 
Immediate corrective actions:
All further maintenance and inspection activity has been halted until such time as systems, policies and procedures are ensured.
We will be providing further information as it becomes available, including a formal root cause document with corrective actions.
We sincerely apologize for the impact this had to your business and that of your customers.  Cologix will act quickly and diligently to ensure that all corrective actions needed are taken."

Eric

Here's the formal one, 'pon the Google Blog, though not in any great
detail.  In short: whatever they build configurations with, for pushing
to servers via cfengine or puppet or whatever they use, had a bug, and
built a broken config, and didn't catch it, and it got pushed.

  http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/todays-outage-for-several-google.html

No details on whether there was contributory control-plane congestion,
as often causes, or extends, AWS outages.

Ironically, Google's Site Reliability Engineering team *was doing an AMA
when the outage hit*.  No comment from the 'plex, either, on whether those
are connected, and the AMAers declined to comment.

  http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w1y5m/we_are_the_google_site_reliability_engineering/

Highlights:

Q: Pager?!?! Why don't you use text messages for that?

A: "Pager" is a synonynm for "A beepy thing that goes 'beep'."

and

I can assure you that Google does not use nagios.
Source: I used to be a Google SRE.

and

Q: Sooo....what's it like there when a Google service goes down? How much freaking out is done?

A: Very little freaking out actually, we have a well-oiled process for this that all services use - we use thoroughly documented incident management procedures, so people understand their role explicitly and can act very quickly. We also exercise this processes regularly as part of our DiRT testing.

Running regular service-specific drills is also a big part of making sure that once something goes wrong, we?re straight on it.

Folo: In a highly parallel environment, it should not be necessary that all pants are shat in unison. The map-reduce pattern allows each dump to be taken in its own time, and then collected once all shits are complete.

Cheers,

so here i think we have the definition of "Big," in Internet terms:  the
only real danger is from internal threats.

On ATT UVerse in Michigan (48104), having problems reaching some web sites
including MLive.com.

I checked "Down detector" for ATT (http://downdetector.com/status/att) and
it's reporting lots of problems nationally. The comments suggest to change
your DNS server and all will be well, so I did (to Google's 8.8.8.8) and
all is indeed well.

FYI. A little writeup here

http://vielmetti.typepad.com/vacuum/2014/01/27-january-2014-att-uverse-dns-server-problems.html

to capture the moment. thanks!

Just a comment: I've had a lot of people say they are having issues today across the nation on AT&T as a result of this.

Thanks for sharing good details Ed.

We've got a managed MPLS site down in MD, I've been given the following update from AT&T:

Activity Type Code Desc: GENERAL COMMENTS

My guess is either a fiber fault somewhere or significant equipment failure.

It is (as you know) abnormally cold here in Maryland, and that means that
lots of aging infrastructure under Baltimore and DC is prone to failure.
When "aging infrastructure" == "big water main" and blinky things are
downstream, problems ensue.  Don't know if that was the case here,
but I doubt the backhoes were out.

Anyway, is there any update on the status of this?

Thanks,
Rich

Sorry, meant to update this morning, but I've been fighting with an independent telco out in Texas all day.

We were told that a "cable repair" team had been deployed to resolve this outage.  We saw our circuit come up around 12:00 AM ET.  At the time AT&T stated they were still actively working the trouble.

The last update on our ticket states (timestamp is CST by the way):

01/29/2014,01:21:07:[AT&T ] 
Activity Type Code Desc: GENERAL COMMENTS
Activity Type Code: GEN
THE FOLLOWING STATUS INFORMATION ON YOUR TROUBLE HAS BEEN SENT FROM
AT&T NETWORK OPERATIONS.
        ...per GNOC, TCB has been closed...check
        ed muliple T3's and see them up as of 23
        :00 on 1/28...closing tickets...

I chatted in with AT&T and they state the RFO was simply "repaired fiber cut."

Wish I could get a little more detail on the event, but that's probably going to be it.  I'll try to bug our service manager for any additional info, but I'm not sure if he'll be able to.

- Matt
