Anyone else seeing slowness on TWTelecom routes?

My colocation confirmed that TWTelecom is having some issues on some of their routes today.  Confirmed issues between ATT Business DSL customers in SoCal and TWTelecom SoCal nodes (207.114.222.94 for example).

Looks like a lot of outages are beginning  to occur in Queensland as
the flooding continues to get worse.

[snip]

The Queensland floods have claimed their first datacentre victim, with
AAPT's facility at 167 Eagle St in Brisbane confirmed to have powered
down. A number of other facilities may be about to follow, as the
statewide disaster continues to trouble technology providers.

Message-ID: <4D2DE5D5.7080005@abenaki.wabanaki.net>

I'm informed that the National Relay Service for the Deaf and Hearing
impaired has gone to minimal service.

"Due to the emergency flood situation in Brisbane, ordinary relay
calls through the NRS are not available at present. Until further
notice the NRS can only relay Emergency 106 calls from TTYs."

This means that Oz-wide, Deaf and Hearing impared are unable to use
public relay services to voice only devices, such as social services
and scheduled medical support.

You may not be aware, but there is major flooding in QLD, AU. 

It has taken down already a data center (AAPT, I think). APNIC online services are not affected tho.

Good morning everyone,

We're trying to track down some stuff, and it appears that DNS
wouldn't resolve.  Has anyone seen any issues with ZoneEdit's DNS
services this morning?  We cannot see anything wrong with it right
now, but wanted to have more data points to rule it out completely.

Thanks!

I have Verizon T1s affected in Spokane - they're blaming a 360 Networks fiber cut between Spokane and Seattle.  I have a Sprint T1 about 2 miles away (Airway Heights, WA) that is not affected.

Reliance just gave us an update saying the issue was caused by a
broadcast storm. This issue impacted all Philadelphia area customers.

The issue has been resolved with a RCA under way.

Sorry I'm not on the outages list but I can confirm this is a Reliance Issue
- they claimed it was a broadcast storm and assured me that it was over
(Philly only).  Master Ticket number is 104793.  I work for FCCC in NE
Philly and we lost all of our Yipes/RelGlob hosted EPL circuits.

OC192 port at NGRNNY (North Greenbush, across river from Albany) went
to protect, explaining the latency, no explanation for errors (unless
maybe it was flapping), but we are back up on the working side, all
clear.

Subject:Connectivity status for Egypt

Around 2236 UCT, we lost all Internet connectivity with our contacts in
Egypt, and I'm hearing reports of (in declining order of confirmability):

1) Internet connectivity loss on major (broadband) ISPs
2) No SMS
4) Intermittent connectivity with smaller (dialup?) ISPs
5) No mobile service in major cities -- Cairo, Alexandria

The working assumption here is that the Egyptian government has made the
decision to shut down all external, and perhaps internal electronic
communication as a reaction to the ongoing protests in that country.

If anyone can provide more details as to what they're seeing, the extent,
plus times and dates, it would be very useful. In moments like this there
are often many unconfirmed rumors: I'm seeking concrete reliable
confirmation which I can pass onto the press and those working to bring some
communications back up (if you have a ham radio license, there is some very
early work to provide emergency connectivity. Info at:

We have some users in the Miami area that have been having issues 
connecting to www.yahoo.com and mail.yahoo.com. I have verified this 
over both Level3 and Globalcrossing. Anyone else seeing any issues?

If you have specific info you can share, I'd be happy to dig
in and see if there's anything about them that can be identified
as problematic.

Thanks!

I'm getting a west coast VIP for www (out of MIA) but working great; with
remarkably low latency.

I think this may be bigger than just yahoo.com and Cogent/Level3, as several carriers are reporting high latency according to:

NTT has been showing high latency like that for at least a few days -- I
had someone notice that and ask about it last week. I think that NTT
latency is probably an unrelated issue to the 'Yahoo down' problem.

I've heard rumors of a fibercut affecting at least XO in the Miami area.

I don't have better details, unfortunately.

However, that might be relevant.

Everything seems to be working now, but during the outage www.yahoo.com 
was loading very slowly and only displaying text and they were getting 
connection timeouts to items loaded on http://l.yimg.com. Traceroutes 
showed no packetloss.

D'oh.

Alright then, let me share some possibly useful information:

We have a 10GB lightwave from Qwest northbound to San Jose, and a 10GB lightwave from Level3 southbound to 1 Wilshire in LAX.  We peer with many IP networks in those locations.  Yahoo is working fine for us here in San Luis Obipso...  ;)
