Just to piss off the anti-doing-business-on-facebook crowd - actually to 
save the rest of us the legwork:

If your facebook apps are broken tonight it's because fb.getLoginStatus is 
barfing on application ID errors.

Operationally this is relavant to me since I got called out of a movie 
theater by the 7 levels of management since our money stopped flowing and 
it took a while to track it down.


For those of you who dont have customers who play or sell facebook games, 
please delete and move on.

There is currently an outage on the Sea-Me-We-4 cable system.

I believe that the failure is near Alexandria in Egypt

This is affecting traffic between Europe and the East as well as a large 
number of circuits to Southern and Eastern Africa.

I believe restoration is expected in about 2 hours.

I'm seeing latency upwards of 300ms off and intermittently flaps off 
TWC....I'm located in s.cal.

I can confirm.  It appears to be DNS primarily, along with webmail.
mail servers and connectivity are up.

There's a reachability issue to DNS and DHCP from 1 Wilshire. It's affecting
all of Southern California and there is no ETR at this time.

If you don't reboot your modem, the lease doesn't expire, and you hit Google
(8.8.8.8) or OpenDNS (208.67.222.222) for DNS it probably will still work.

Yeah well, DNS went down ~6pm so I pointed to 4.2.2.4 (Verizon) and  
that apparently worked for me until 10:44pm or so (based on the last  
email in my Outlook on my laptop), but then I lost total connectivity  
after that and still have nothing (just got home a few mins ago and  
noticed it)...currently on hold with them for 15 mins so far... :p

Like I had said in an earlier thread, I didn't have any issues with my TWC connection.  However, after 10:40 PM my ssh connections were timing out to servers at multiple locations up and down the coast.  Web browsing was fine though.

While they're reachable on comcast's network from Boston, neither (WI or
IL servers) appear to be answering DNS requests,

I can't reach those (from Comcast in Oregon).
I've been having intermittent DNS issues out here too tonight, I
switched to Google DNS.

I was also having the same issue - switched my DNS to use Google's public
DNS servers
(8.8.8.8 & 8.8.4.4) and all is good now.
fyi: just saw Tweets from @ComcastCares that evidently, Mn, IL & MI all seem
to be having issues
and that Comcast is working on a fix.

Interesting. No issues showing from the Comcast.net DNS page. I also don't see either of those IP addresses listed there.

Detroit servers).

Comcast confirms the issue:

http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r25163231-

It's hard to suggest that their NOC isn't competent over something like this.
Whose responsibility is communication to the customer?
Most NOC's are only responsible for acting as middle-men to alert
engineers when a problem appears, or to solve basic issues.

Let's leave the pejorative remarks at the door, please.

And if the purpose of such status pages on websites for such vendor was to
actually provide information, rather than to give the vendor's unwashed 
customer base a warm, moist feeling, then that would be a great idea.  :-)

I have also lost internet connectivity with my Aurora, IL office.  Qwest's
tech support line is warning of long hold times because of a wide spread
outage in the mid west.  My circuits are up just not getting past the switch
port at Qwest.

Better Tuesday morning and not late Friday afternoon.

Our gig-E to Indianapolis seems unaffected but couple T1s in northern
Indiana, Dublin, OH, Southern Indiana seems to be having reachability
problem.  Qwest circuits on the east coast and west coast seems
unaffected so far.

All of our circuits have come back up.  Getting into the routers and
looking at the logs, the line protocol and physical interface actually
bounced couple times.  I haven't gotten any explanation from Qwest
other than it's a "higher level protocol issue" and the NOC engineers
were working on it.

Hi -

Did anyone notice any connectivity issues in Metro LA and San Diego area?

It might be related to Operation Payback's DDoS on PayPal. We've seen some issues sending traffic over Level3.

Our outbound started working again about 15 mins ago as well as our inbound
DASH numbers. Last email we got from them was at 4:50pm MST that just said:

"Outage Notification Update:

Please be advised that dash Carrier Services continues to investigate the
network outage and is working ot resolve the issue. An update will be

The last word was that it had something to do with the 'SBCs'. Calls are
still working fine this morning and we're supposed to hear what the actual
outage cause was and what they did to resolve and what they plan to do to
keep this from occurring in the future.

The last email from them regarding this was yesterday at 8:00pm MST:

"Outage Notification Update:

Calls continue to process successfully and dash has observed no further
issues in the SBCs.  dash will continue to monitor all call processing very
closely.

A detailed description and reason for the outage shall be provided tomorrow.
 Additionally, dash will continue to work with Acme Packet until a root
cause is determined."

Anyone happen to know what's going on with Comcast in the LA area?  DreamHost, my hosting provider, reports:

Reduced Download Speeds
Posted (December 15th, 2010 at 11:23 am PST) by Sandon
We have noticed some performance issues with one of our transit providers that provide us connectivity to the internet. Speeds are significantly lower than usual but latency appears to have stayed the same. We are contacting the transit provider to troubleshoot the issue and will post updates.

The reduced performance is not bad enough where it should effect regular browsing of web-sites but might be noticeable on large file downloads. Upload speeds to our network appear to be unaffected.

UPDATE 6pm PST: The ticket we opened with the provider (Comcast) is being looked into, and we?re waiting to hear back from them. We?ll update this post again as soon as we get news.


Was wondering if anyone here knew more.

[snippage]

I can't share any direct light on this but can indirectly verify that
something is going on.

We're a regional ISP in Santa Barbara.  The speedtest.net site defaults
to Dreamhost in Los Angeles for our customers based on geolocation.

Our support team has had complaints of poor speeds based on customers
using speedtest.net.  Indeed, choosing the Dreamhost default absolutely
crawls.  Choosing another server results in expected results.

It's interesting how this type of supposedly unrelated issue can affect
people who normally wouldn't notice it.

I was just about to post on the list about it.

Just about everything going over L3 for me is not working.

According to Level3 they had a router failure in the WDC area.  Master
ticket is 4521074.  They report the issue is isolated and services are

Did anyone have issues in the mountain region with Internet that someone noticed.
We had some high response times randomly to our Data center in CO. All our IP gear tested out clean locally

By the time we engaged our Data center/ISP, the issue went away so they could not collect much data. I was wondering if someone else noticed anything similar. Our Data center people told us that east of the Chicago there were some issues but not to the West.

We had a few complaints yesterday about latency but it was too short
lived for us to really isolate it to any particular carrier or device.
We use mostly XO and Level(3) out of the Detroit market. The issue was
in the late afternoon eastern, so probably around the 4-5pm MST window
you mentioned.

Unofficially, I was able to get signed-on during the beginning of the
outage.  I have not signed out since, but my status has been flapping from
online > offline periodically.

Is anyone experiencing issues with Level3 in the Southeast?  We are using them as one of our upstreams and am seeing our peering bouncing with them.  Not sure if it's a localized issue or something more widespread.

Yes our BGP started bouncing and I ended up shutting them down.  I have a

Unofficially I am told they our having issues with 2 trunks over their Metro

We have received confirmation that they do have an issue and have a tech onsite (where ever that is) to resolve the issue.  We have shutdown our peer with them for the time being as well.

Anyone notice issues for 5-10 mins around 530 pm yesterday. We received a few calls about high latency to our servers. Internal verification found nothing on our Servers and our data center provider/ISP is claiming no issues on their equipment either, so wanted to check if anyone else had similar experience around that time.

Holidays have been full of IP issues....

Thanks.  According to the spec sheet, AT&T, Level3, SAVVIS, Verizon, Qwest,
and X/O are there.  Through which provider were your customers experiencing
latency?
