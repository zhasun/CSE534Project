Sprint technician informed us that there was a power outage in the Baltimore
site on 11/28/06 between 2-3:00 PM EST.  During this outage, several our
clients could access our network.  This incident re-occured again the next
day between 1:45-4:15 PM.

Does anyone have further info?

Drew,

There is definitely a power outage at telx/60 Hudson.  According to telx,
this was a scheduled maintenance gone bad.  I have someone onsite and he is
reporting that power should be restored shortly.

Note, those with redundant feeds within the facility should only see a
partial outage.

Regards,

Randy

This doesn't answer your question, but I got curious..

excerpted from http://www.sec.noaa.gov/ftpdir/indices/events/yesterday.txt --

2740       1903   1957      2305  HOL  3   FLA  S05E75    1F      ERU       0930

I am not an expert, but I believe this indicates that an "Optical
flare observed in H-alpha" took place between 1903 and 1957 UTC

Just some further info on this- 2 receivers, different mfg.,  40 miles
away from each other had issues in the same 10 minute period.
The alarm was "not enough satellites visible", but usually they both see
a minimum of 8-11 birds , which is more than enough. So perhaps the
solar flare was to blame.  It was not service affecting, since both have
rubidium oscillators. Just scary since we had never rec'd the alarm
before (with nightmarish  visions of network collapse :)
Thanks all for the input.

In addition to that solar flare, there is also a mild geomagnetic
storm in progress. With the solar flare, it was on the opposite side
of the sun from that of earth. With x-rays being rather directional, I
am thinking the solar flares may not be to blame.

Anyways, cool space weather website:

I don't know a thing abt solar events, but the graphs on that page
suggest that something out of the ordinary is happening right now (see
the Proton Flux graph).  Very interesting.

>From http://sec.noaa.gov/today.html :

3-day Solar-Geophysical Forecast issued Dec 6 at 22:00 UTC
Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be high. Region 930
is expected to produce M-class flares and there is a good chance for
further X-class activity.

Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected to be
unsettled to active on 07 - 08 December with a chance for periods of minor
or major storm conditions due to the recurrent coronal hole high speed
stream. Quiet to unsettled conditions are expected on 09 December. The
greater than 10 MeV proton event is expected to continue for at least
another 24 hours.

This is getting a bit off-topic, but we have a space weather center for a
reason. Such solar flares can even cause the power grid to black
out. Think EMP on satelites, as well. There is a monitoring satelite
half-way between earth and the Sun to give just such warnings.

If my planet were destroyed, I might complain.  Especially if I didn't

Getting back on topic, if you were using HSRP (Hot Standby Replacement
Planet) on your gear, this would be a non-issue.

Apologies, to clarify:

Here we may have peer-moderation, but we also have active (yet very low
key admins). Meaning, as this list is about operational announcements,
these announcements need to take precedent.

This is not a discussion list.

Some discussion is encouraged when issues are happening, and the whole
Sun issue is relevant, despite sounding far-fetched, and was indeed 
enlightening. NANOG moderation is off-topic, as it takes attention away
from announcements which is what we are about.

Thanks guys, let's please move on.

	Gadi.

*sigh* bad me for ignoring my <STOP>, but ...

being standards-conforming, rather than proprietary protocol players, we
use VRRP (Very Reliable Redundant Planet).  you DID note that I spoke in
the subjunctive, didn't you?

Magnetic storm approaching Earth
14.12.2006 15:43 

Russian weather scientists expect increase of geomagnetic activity and a
very powerful magnetic storm to happen between December, 14 and 15.

The third outburst was detected on the Sun, which resulted in the increase
of wave absorption on the illuminated surface of our planet in a day or two,
the research press release from the Institute of Earth's Magnetism said. The
scientist said storm to be the strongest magnetic storm for the year 2006.
The storm is predicted to be even stronger than the one detected in April.
Radio communications, satellites and power grids could face potential
interruptions or damage, however.

Subject: [Outages] Abovenet fibre cut; Washington D.C.
Message-ID: <20061220182903.GA65316@icarus.home.lan>

At around 09:57 PST, we saw heavy amounts of packet loss via our
Abovenet connection via the Fort Worth/Dallas area.

Abovenet's IP group has stated that there's a fibre cut in the
Washington D.C. area which is affecting their "southern route",
and peering between Chicago<->DC, FTW/Dallas<->DC, and northern
Virginia<->DC was affected.

Reconvergence took place (for the west coast) in San Jose, going
out of four OC48s destined to Chicago, but those became saturated.

I don't have any other details, other than an RFO will be provided.

The email I got from AboveNet about the "network event" in the DC area 
said that their core routers rebooted.  They haven't mentioned a fiber cut 
to me.

I've gotten three statements -- one from their IP NOC via phone,
(which is who told us there was a fibre cut in the DC area), then
a few minutes later an Email stating that a "networking event had
occured", then another one about core routers rebooting.

Whoever I spoke to in their NOC was coherent and seemed to know
a bit about what was going on and was very helpful.  So if there
was not a fibre cut, I was simply told the wrong thing by Abovenet.

We just lost visibility to sites in APAC for no less than 4 of our
customers, across multiple carriers (Singtel primarily).  That explains
a lot.

Looks like there's some type of outage at the Verizon West Street CO
(New York City) any one else see anything funny going on?  Having
problems making calls outside the CO as well as issues with private
lines. I'm on hold right now, seeing if I can find anything out.

Service was restored for a bit now it's back down, Verizon has no further
information other than "it's a major problem and we're working on it."

I called Verizon, as we are anxiously awaiting our customers' networks
to come back on-line. They are still working a cross connect issue,
but no estimated time of repair.

Not sure how many of you got impacted by quest outage.

http://www.daily-times.com/ci_4926735

Hopefully someday (wishful thinking) ISPs can be more proactive in
reporting their planned & unplanned outages to public forum(s) such as
outages mailing list <grin>. Similar to security advisory reporting
which is now a standard practice.
