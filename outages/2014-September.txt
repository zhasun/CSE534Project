Based on customer complaints and looking at twitter it seems that GoDaddy
is having DNS issues. Here in the US using 8.8.8.8 and 4.2.2.2 it is
working for me. Using local resolvers in Israel it is not.

I agree.  To add to this, The Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8, etc) discuss
list is recently full of many statements like this (from Google
employees)

"please ask GoDaddy to unblock Google Public DNS."
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/public-dns-discuss/OFXPR6-M6Kk/J_ZeM8oCLJ4J

So something unusual is happening at GD.

Is anyone else seeing issues with Level3's DNS servers?   We got an alert
our mail servers were down but mail is flowing normally, if slowly.  Trying
to resolve our domain names against Google's 8.8.8.8 and OpenDNS's
208.67.222.222 servers seems fine but 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.1 is spotty at best,
failing to resolve in most cases.

 

Testing www.google.com <http://www.google.com>  and www.amazon.com
<http://www.amazon.com>  yields the same results.

Message-ID: <CAFxMtF9bgsZS+c5GfXJC2Vk4vu3XN2A-rN2TZf8dPsTz3cVwEA@mail.gmail.com>

A few of our client domains just suddenly started failing to resolve. As it
turns out, those domains are ones whose name service is handled via
GoDaddy. There's a thread on Reddit that suggests that this is pretty
widespread, but the exact scope isn't known yet, and GD has not announced
the issue.

http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2fczdc/godaddy_premium_dns_down/



Dig queries to domains that are on PDNS01 or PDNS02 fail. There are
probably others.

Not sure about L3, but I have confirmation that GoDaddy Premium DNS
services are all down at the moment.  I spoke with a rep and he informed me
that they don't have an estimate on return to service yet but that they
have all hands on deck working on this.

We?ve had major packet loss and routing issues with Cox at 9:48AM CST this morning in the Dallas area. Possibly unrelated but time correlates.

Not sure about L3, but I have confirmation that GoDaddy Premium DNS services are all down at the moment.  I spoke with a rep and he informed me that they don't have an estimate on return to service yet but that they have all hands on deck working on this.

We are seeing queries to PDNS02 being refused depending on anycast

The CL edge point at 199.44.253.1 started dropping large amounts of traffic
at around 11:40 EST.  It seems to have smoothed out for now, but it dropped
all of our tunnels for about 15 minutes.

It was only down for me in Denver on Comcast for a few minutes. It has been
back up for me for around 20 minutes. I'm connecting via v6.

Facebook was being observed not to be able to refresh web UI newsfeeds here
around 1600EDT, via Sprint LTE.  It's now working again.

Android client via the same connection seemed to be working, as were XMPP
connections to FB chat.

They've been having issues with a router for the last couple of days. They ended up performing emergency maintenance on it this morning @~5:45 mountain to replace the supervisor card.  They've confirmed that the hardware is stable now.

The root cause was a faulty supervisor card on a router. It was scheduled to be replaced tomorrow at 6pm GMT.

When the router crashed again today they decided to perform the maintenance early to stabilize things.

We saw a similar issue on Tuesday afternoon. Hard down for 5 minutes and then about an hour of lingering bgp issues.

More than just their 'pdns' premium DNS servers are down today.
NS31.DOMAINCONTROL.COM and NS32.DOMAINCONTROL.COM ping but don't respond to
A or MX requests regardless of where I source from:

As I typed this email 'NS31.DOMAINCONTROL.COM' came back up, but NS32 is
still down.

Their phone tech support says they can't find a problem.  And their status
page says "No Significant Issues":
http://support.godaddy.com/system-alerts/

Totally inexcusable.

I have been using dnsmadeeasy.com since their last outage 2 years ago and

If you are having problems, still through Thursday night, with DNS resolution
off of GoDaddy hosted zone servers, could you reply to *this* thread and 
provide succinct details of what, when, and how?  A friend is on their staff
and has the proper ear to whisper in.

If you aren't and don't care, well, you know how to use procmail.  :-)

Your description of the problem is about as informative as theirs ;-)
Granted, I've seen far worse... I should know, I worked at HE for 8 years.

They refused to give anything more. First they said it was a power issue
"somewhere" then they said it was something else. Over all the issue was
heavy packet loss. The issue has since been resolved.

Subject: [outages] TWC / 260 5th Ave / NYC
Message-ID: <005901cfc947$abca5a20$035f0e60$@webjogger.net>

We have a customer at 260 5th Ave in NYC who has been having intermittent
outages on their Time Warner Cable connection for the last 2-4 weeks. They,
their entire building, and actually their entire block, is currently hard
down. They are having issues getting acknowledgement from Time Warner
regarding the issues, much less an ETA to recovery. 

 

Would anyone happen to have any insight into what is going on down there,
and when the root cause might be resolved?

 

Customer is actively seeking alternative providers as well in light of the
situation.

 

Thanks,

Adam

Religious Mass? State of Massachusetts? What an odd explanation!

again.

their 800 number wasn't working either by the way.

thanks

I wouldn?t blame one wilshire on any of there power test or maintenance,
they do give plenty of notice, I m a direct customer of one wilshire so we
do get these notices.  + these test and maintenances are to assure no
random outage I give kudos to one wilshire (core site).  The power outage
from a couple months ago was the lack of maintenance on pacwest part.

Similar issues observed in Charlotte NC, had to shutdown that peer for
over an hour.  Still no response on my initial ticket, which is very
uncommon for them.

Similar issues outbound from Seattle...issue started as serious
inbound (mostly EU) issues...inbound seemed OK for a bit but still
having outbound issues it looks like so I've removed them from my mix
for now.

Well, that was brilliant, wasn't it? Schedule a big planned maintenance that ends up black holing traffic right before a huge Apple keynote...

If an ISP puts off maintenance for every big announcement some other 
company makes, the number of maintenance windows will be reduced more 
than what they are. Looks to me like there was a backout or BC plan for 
this maintenance so this really is a 'nothing to see here, move along' 
event.

Message-ID: <2101655215.9737200.1410368856461.JavaMail.root@impulse.net>

Is anyone else being impacted or have more information about a Verizon fiber ring repair in LA that went south yesterday afternoon? A client's fiber is STILL down more than 16 hours later, and the only information I have is that it is a configuration/provisioning issue with no ETR! 

This is new ground -- I have never an outage of this type, and rarely of this duration. Any further information is appreciated.

Subject: [outages] cogent issue loading youtube videos
Message-ID: <54177976.6090906@outages.org>

Is anyone else experiencing youtube related issues off Cogent where
one is able to load the base site but not able to load videos? Per
Cogent support this is something google is blocking but I don't have
issues off Verizon peer

Unfortunately due to bandwidth reasons I cannot swing over to Verizon
so I'm stuck

Any validation will be greatly appreciated

Update:

Issues has been resolved as of this am...per cogent team google was
randomly blocking certain IPs off 38.0.0.0/8 supernet

No further explanation was given except they have reached out to
google peering team for further explanation

Is anyone else seeing excessive packet loss between ATT and XO in Chicago? We started seeing this this morning, and the problem looks like it might actually be within XO's network in Chicago but I'm not 100% certain. I have no info from either carrier as of yet.

Hop #6 is 216.156.0.185

I don't think its only in Chicago. We normally go ATT AS7018 via XO out of Dallas, but I can't get there right now.

Originating from AS19754 BGP against XO in Dallas Equinix.

Access to ipv6.cnn.com went down at 10:45 am.  Level3's looking glass shows
that 2620:100:e000::/48 is still being advertised, but traceouroutes don't
get into TimeWarner's network.

Definitely noticeable here in ASEAN-land - some ISPs lost ~50% of their international peering bandwidth.  I believe the break was related to the typhoon; no world on ETR.

Our monitoring system has seen HTTPv6 access to www.facebook.com timeout

Anyone else seeing something similar over IPv4 or v6?

Message-ID: <CAAdV5S53wTe4ENiukQNjKz_+w-pWJhtQmupw9XBtS5rPM80=tg@mail.gmail.com>

Google Hangouts Chrome Extension appears to be down.

Mobile works, and integrated from Gmail is up.

Nothing yet at http://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&v=status

I am experiencing this, and am getting reports from users around the state.

Thanks,

Does anyone know anything about the IP 38.104.251.246 ? After looking at
google, it seems like it's for psi-net.com, and it's one of the routers on
the way to my server.

Running a ping on that IP, majority of the packets are dropped, and it's
causing my site to go down from time to time.

Samer,

 

Please read this slide deck on traceroutes: https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog47/presentations/Sunday/RAS_Traceroute_N47_Sun.pdf  It should help clarify what you?re seeing.

 

If you have any subsequent questions, please post them on outages-discussion.

 

Thanks,

 

Frank Bulk

Does anyone know anything about the IP 38.104.251.246 ? After looking at google, it seems like it's for psi-net.com <http://psi-net.com> , and it's one of the routers on the way to my server. 

Running a ping on that IP, majority of the packets are dropped, and it's causing my site to go down from time to time.

Are you actually getting loss to the destination?

What you?re seeing could be the result of control-plane policing kicking in - it might be helpful if you could post a traceroute, or give us the actual destination address of your server?

Just because the router IP is showing loss doesn?t mean its not forwarding packets happily?

I will point out a couple of free web-based tools you also may wish to look
at:

Internet Health Report - http://www.internetpulse.net/

Traceroute engines from various looking glasses across the globe:
http://www.traceroute.org

Check to see if your site is publicly accessible or not:
http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/

It would help us to help you if you can provide either the name or IP
address of the web host you are attempting to reach - your web server in
this case.

Yes, PacWest had to perform emergency maintenance overnight, which devolved into an outage. The last update we heard was for an anticipated ETR of 10:00 EDT, which has now passed, obviously.

Yes,

TNCI reports, calls inbound to Telastic are failing with no audio in either direction. 

They were replacing a line card and it was suppose to be completed at 5AM PST. They just gave a new ETA of 8AM PST.
