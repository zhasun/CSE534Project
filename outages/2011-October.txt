Yeah, NANOG's kicking it around too, the last 15 or 30 minutes.  Some people
still have connectivity, some don't.  I'm pondering a netsplit, so far.

Yes, I believe their Fremont data center may be under a DDoS attack.  Our
own monitoring system for HE's www.he.net (v6 site) showed several ups and
downs starting at 4:59 pm Central until 5:42 pm Central  

 

This is also being discussed on twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/search/henet

HE's entire network is intermittently down.  They claim it is a DoS:
	<https://twitter.com/#!/henet/status/120951537974513665>

It is not the first time this week.

Mike & the team are good engineers, they'll do what they can to bring it backup quickly.

There are lots of other rumors floating around, but I think you should wait for official word.  HE is not a telco, they will tell you what happened.

I pick up transit with HE at Telehouse (25 Broadway).  Traffic flowing 
through them died after it hit their edge.  Something must be hosed in 
their core as things got better once I shutdown the session between us.

I haven't called them to get the scoop, I figure they've probably got 
their hands full now.

Yeah, NANOG's kicking it around too, the last 15 or 30 minutes.  Some people
still have connectivity, some don't.  I'm pondering a netsplit, so far.

I'm now able to get to the sites, traceroutes still coming up unresponsive.

I wonder if this was/is related to the HE outage?

I am told by a regular poster that a downsized HVAC employee frobbed the Big
Red Switch in one of their 6 datacenters on his way out the door for the last
time, leading to this outage; cannot confirm or deny.

Whether it's true or not, it's an excellent cautionary tale WRT dismissal 
procedures.

Seems to be working from here.  Our process involves one of our VP's following people out the door.  I'm pretty sure a tank might be afraid of him pissed off... :)  We also have a clause in the "Employment Agreement" that states "Any and all damages and or resolution for damages due to hostile employee actions during or after a dismissal will be billed to the former employee.  Time spent resolving damages will be billed at contractor rates, or internal service billing rates, whichever is higher."  Don't think anyone has ever had to pay fines though :)

It does seem to be back now, though it was checking down when I got the report.

I was seeing it up but devoid of content; just a framework of boxes. The
content is back now.

Subject: [outages] XO slowness
Message-ID: <EE3A1AFB71A1E54BA3D302718EA382F94ADF7F@server1.WaveformTechnology.local>

Is anyone seeing general XO slowness this morning? We noticed at approx
midnight Eastern a drop in traffic on our link to them, and testing
shows sessions limited to about 1-2Mb/s in the outbound (to XO)
direction while inbound runs normally. This is per-session, the
aggregate is still gigs so I don't think it's just an overloaded link
somewhere. 

 

We have redundant links into different core routers within XO's network
in the Detroit market and we see the same issue with both so I'm pretty
sure this problem is somewhere further into XO's network than just our
interconnect to them. Their support number is reporting heavy load and a
"VoIP services" problem so I'm curious if anyone knows if they are
having a large-scale IP problem of some kind.

Too bad. they've been having a lot of problems. 

 

 

 

Grasshopper is experiencing a service interruption that impacts your account. As a result of a database issue that occurred during a
normal maintenance procedure, all phone and web services are currently down.

 

The issues started at approximately 4 am (EDT). We're trying to fix this as quickly as possible, but don't have an estimate for how
much longer this will last at this time. We'll be posting regular updates to this status

When I got through, the NOC reported that the Greentree datacenter had an AC
outage due to breakers throwing. Around 2AM Eastern time, they said it was
back on but they were continuing to diagnose the problems. I haven't heard
anything since.

Facebook has dropped their full-window "popout" chat interface, which was
deprecated a while back (you could use it if you still had the URL laying
around, but the link to it was gone)...

and in the wake of that, I find that their instructions here:

  https://www.facebook.com/sitetour/chat.php

for setting up XMPP clients like Pidgin to connect to chat no longer work.

If you use XMPP to chat on Facebook, could you contact me offlist and let me
know if it a) works, b) just broke, or c) hasn't worked in a while?

If you work in Facebook Engineering, um... :-)

Cheers,

Well, this is twice in a row, which is a little bit embarassing.

I was using the wrong password, folks.  Amazing how much better it works when
you get that little detail right.  2 days setting up gear in a 68F colo rack
will kill you, apparently.

Thanks to several people who looked into this, this afternoon; my apologies
for the noise.

bing.com, and probably lots of other things I haven't checked.

Traces die at
146.137.69.4.in-addr.arpa	name = ae-0-11.bar2.Orlando1.Level3.net.

I'm seeing this both from work, where we have Level3 and TWTelecom, and 
from home on my BHN cable (which relies heavily on Level3 for transit). 
At work, shutting our BGP session to Level3 has resolved things...but I 
hate being singlehomed.  Our NOC claimed they couldn't get through (busy 
signal) to Level3's NOC, so I just called L3 from my cell, got through, 
opened a ticket, and the guy I spoke with was unaware of any issues.

Anyone else seeing this?

I didn't get the call from our NOC (who heard from Level3's) that things 
were supposed to be fixed until 0630.  I turned our Level3 BGP back on, 
and verified that things were back to normal.  Based on traces to what was 
broken, it looks like there was something wrong between Level3's Orlando 
and Miami POPs.

Request for participation - Arbor 2011 Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report. 

-----

Folks,

We're in the process of collecting survey responses for the 2011 Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report (WWISR); this is the Seventh Edition of the Report, and we'd really be grateful for your participation!  This is the only security-focused survey we're aware of which is specifically oriented towards those who design, build, operate, and defend public-facing network infrastructure/applications/services, and provides an opportunity to share your experiences and perspectives with your peers within the operational community, as well as to benefit from their shared experiences and perspectives.

The 2011 Infrastructure Security Survey is up and available for your input.  You can register and complete the survey via this URL, which will redirect your browser to the survey tool (the survey itself is accessed via http/s):

<http://www.arbornetworks.com/survey/ISR2011>

Once again, we've added several insightful questions from past participants.  Survey collection will end as soon as we've reached the desired number of respondents (ideally, 100+).

The survey results will be published in the 2011 Worldwide Infrastructure Security Report during January of 2012.  Also, please note that *no* personally- or organizationally-identifiable information will be shared in any manner.

The 2010 edition of the Report is available here (registration required):

<http://www.arbornetworks.com/report>

Thanks in advance!

Anyone else see Level3 take a dump in ATL around 17:45 UTC?

We took a dive on our Level3 transit connection there around that time and when I looked at the peering session, it showed up 24weeks but they were only showing us 100K prefixes.  I didn't see this on our Level3 peering sessions in IAD or on the left coast.

Hello John,

We did we as well looks like they had an issue that lasted about an
hour.  Based on what we saw they dropped all routes that did not
originate from 3356.

We lost connectivity to out Level(3) colo at 180 Peachtree in Atl for about 12 minutes. 

Seems to have recovered. Level3 support had no knowledge of an ongoing issue when we called in.

We are noticing a packet loss issue on our AT&T circuit to Google
service. I have an open ticket with AT&T but they insist that it is a
google issue.
We are getting 50% packet loss to both www.google.com and 8.8.8.8.
These are both taking the same route jumping from AT&T to Google.
Trace route & pings are good up to 12.94.87.18. AT&T says that is
google's router even though it is there IP.

Anyone know how to let google know there is an issue with one of there
AT&T pipes?

I'm seeing the same thing to Google via CenturyLink (which goes through
AT&T).  The last AT&T hop with reverse DNS appears to be in Atlanta.

Most likely they already know. Just in case they don't, I've forwarded
your message to someone there :)

If you're reporting an outage on the list, and you conducted a traceroute
that failed, remember to post it at the end of your message; it's usually
more helpful than not.

I personally recommend 'mtr -r -c 10' (accompanied with 'mtr -nr -c 10', since
sometimes you want all the IPs, and that's mtr's one blind spot), but any
trace is better than none, whether you're reporting a problem, a meetoo,
or a WFM.

Cheers,

I've been noticing packet loss while pinging 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2, and 4.2.2.3
in the last few minutes, which are usually my go to IP addresses for

DNS also seems to be intermittent.

I've been noticing packet loss while pinging 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2, and 4.2.2.3
in the last few minutes, which are usually my go to IP addresses for
testing external server connectivity.

DNS also seems to be intermittent.

You guys know that 4.2.2.[123] are anycast, so you get to different
servers depending on where you enter the Level3 network, right?

Mentioning just in case some have missed this.

I assume that that 4.2.2.1 is anycast, because my own path is different
(going to Chicago) and good.  Looks like the problem is in Dallas.

Under normal circumstances, I typically see at least one more hop in front
of 4.2.2.2, and much lower latency.

 From this, I assume the packet loss I'm seeing is due to a problem within
Level 3's network. And may be limited to a Dallas link/router, based on
others' reports.

Not to possibly point out the obvious, but 4.2.2.2 is an anycast address, so
you'll be hitting all sorts of different destiantions when trying to trace to
it, depending on where you are.

e.g., I tested from a few shells I have around:

LA:
  6. ae-21-70.car1.LosAngeles1.Le  0.0%     5   10.8  11.8   9.3  18.2   3.6
  7. vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net         0.0%     5    9.7  11.0   9.7  12.6   1.2

TX:
  6. xe-8-1-0.edge4.Dallas3.Level  0.0%     5    0.6   0.7   0.6   0.9   0.1
  7. ae-31-80.car1.Dallas1.Level3  0.0%     5  163.2 157.8 123.5 181.6  22.2
  8. vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net        80.0%     5   30.0  30.0  30.0  30.0   0.0


Bay Area (Fremont):
  6. ae-11-60.car1.SanJose1.Level  0.0%     5    2.1   6.0   1.9  22.0   9.0
  7. vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net         0.0%     5    2.0   2.0   1.9   2.1   0.1

So it seems that (at least) the one in TX might have issues).

About 3pm we lost some major links and are working a ticket with Level3. They are indicating
It is a likely failed module between Houston and Denton, TX. No ETR at this time.  Not sure it
Is associated with the intermittent ICP/DNS issues...

We have a Qwest MPLS VPN connection in Boise and saw the same drop from 
04:05 to 04:14 MDT.   BGP did not drop, but GRE tunnels on our router did.

Ditto. Our side of the /30 we share with Qwest was unreachable from approx 
4:05 to 4:12 AM MT. Haven't looked yet to see if our BGP session dropped 
during that time. If not we (they) were likely blackholing traffic 
briefly.

I'm monitoring the v6 version of www.twtelecom.com (2001:4870:800d:fe1::11)
and saw it go down from 1:48 am (Central) to 4:25 am (Central), so
essentially the same time.

I'm a TWT customer, and still not seeing the /32, but am seeing lots of 
more specific /48's from it.

I thought this was interesting though:

I don't think I actually checked which prefix we were seeing when connectivity was restored at the time I posted my follow-up.  Right now we are seeing two prefixes from TWTC:
2001:4870::/31
2620:81:8000::/48

(and also 2001:4870:E00B::/48 from a path transiting 4323)

I don't know for sure whether they were advertising the /31 or /32 before the event this morning but regardless 2001:4870::/32 wasn't reachable in the DFZ (as itself or as a superprefix).  bgp.he.net still shows them advertising a /32, so I suspect they only changed to a /31 very recently - potentially during or after this outage.

It's possible that the TWTC's customer advertisements are different than
their peering ones, no?

I'm a TWT customer, and still not seeing the /32, but am seeing lots of 
more specific /48's from it.

I thought this was interesting though:

I hadn't looked for less specific, since the /32 was specifically 
mentioned.  I am seeing the /31.

My collector saw the /32 for "all year", and since today, only the /31
plus a single /48.

The ARIN delegation records claim "it has always been allocated as a /31"
(since 2005).
