Message-ID: <51AA0734.4040708@garlic.com>

Good morning,

Started getting calls from end-users around 6am PDT complaining their
dial-up service is not working.

Appears to be affecting managed modems in Area Codes 530 & 916.  Calls
fail to "All Circuits are Busy".

Calls to O1's main support number (888-444-1111) also fail to "All
Circuits are Busy".

Anyone from O1 around?

-Robert

Frank / Robert,
We have an OC-48 down in LATA 726 that carries our voice trunking into SCRMCA01.  We are escalating it with the circuit provider.  They were performing maintenance on this sonet path last night and something appears to have gone wrong.

Thanks,

Blaine Reeve

Update 21:19 EST

This DDoS attack is different from our previous ones in that it looks as
if the target is us, easyDNS, not one of our clients.

It is proving difficult to isolate the real traffic from the DDoS
traffic, we are having some success now and are working on routing more
DNS traffic through those nodes that are successfully mitigating.

Some customers are adding out-of-band nameservers and loading their
zonedata from here (which is working), as outlined in:

http://blog.easydns.org/2010/08/19/dos-attacks-and-dns-how-to-stay-up-if-your-dns-provider-goes-down/

We'll be posting another update shortly.

Our Cogent peering in Chicago has been solid for a long time.  I do see a dip in inbound traffic in that 6:55 window, but it's not a big enough dip to be distinguishable from regular noise, and we're only polling at 5 minute intervals anyway, so nothing conclusive there.  There was a bit of spike in BGP updates received right around then too, but again nothing crazy.

We're in Chicago, and we've been having sporadic issues with Cogent for several weeks.  We're a cloud software provider with 1000+ clients nationwide, and the issue cropped up again on Friday afternoon for clients in Colorado and locations west.  Cogent said it was an unresolved peering issue with Qwest.  Anyone else?

There was an issue with Bell (AS577) to Cogent in Chicago yesterday as
well (~ 14:15 to 17:20 GMT-4). I had a ticket open with Cogent and they
told me the issue was on Bell's side.  Not sure where the issue was
ultimately.

Some updates:

Per LEC report -- someone stole the fiber.
Per LEC tkt note as of 446p CT --
Someone stole the fiber on the N end of the intersection; crews wrkg on 
it/ no ETTR. Multiple customers affected. 432 count + 216 count are gone.

I wonder how much you can get for fiber at the scrap yard :)

The other 5 have serial 1370607008 and only contain records for .io itself
and nothing for any subdomains, at least for all I tested.

No problems here as far as I know, but keep us updated.  We're going to get a lot of rain here in the DC area, and I'd like to know if there are any issues potentially related to flooding.

The NSA is installing an intercept DACS.   Nothing to see here, move along.

Looks like ns1.communitydns.net and b.nic.io might still be returning valid
answers. Possibly a transient error when I first tested them.

The other five name servers are returning NXDOMAIN for all subdomains.

As your trace demonstrated, git.io is not delegated, although the registry suggests it should be:

Hmm, you're correct. I was able to resolve git.io a few minutes ago, now I can't; something may have hit cache expiry. 

My apologies for the noise.

I was able to resolve two of the domains I own from NYC & Virginia.

http://www.nic.io/ loads no problem, as do other .io sites.

Carrier has indicated this is a localized outage - affects more than us,

Is anyone else experiencing problems with Feedly? It's not "down" per se,
but when pointing your browser at the site, it just says "Synchronizing
feedly v.14.0.485. Please wait."


Thanks,

I sometimes experience that error - *usually* closing my browser fixes it (not always).  I think it looks partially up as a function of the plugin initially renders.

We are seeing the same issues with customer VPN/VOIP traffic having issues traversing to Verizon through Cogent. Here's what appears to be their canned response.

"Dear Cogent Customer,

The latency and/or packet loss that you are experiencing to this destination is due to occasional high traffic with Verizon. Our peering engineers are actively working with Verizon to address this as quickly as possible."

Anybody heard any more details, or an ETA?

Curl works for me too but trying to actually load the page in firefox on
ubuntu just gets stuck endlessly loading.

Just had a colleague complaing of similar problems with opening another
cloudflare hosted site: http://www.mikogo.com/

It kinda feels like an MTU issue though.

hi,

from my pov in europe I see intermittent issues:

- via a frankfurt HE tunnel the CF host (through TELIA) is reached with
a MTU of 1432
- via a london HE tunnel the CF host (through NLAYER) is reached with a
MTU of 1432
- via native connection through INTEROUTE is reached with a MTU of 1432

I can confirm what Graham said: the browser cannot load the page.

same issue, lasted 6 hours, reported on 30 may

Hmm, there may be MTU issues, but I think I have just routing problems to 
start.  All of my traffic is going to go out Level3 (at least right now). 
Doing a trace from level3 (Cincinnati - which is where our circuits come 
from) results in timeouts:

This is fixed now.  It was a Level3 specific routing issue - I worked with 
them and it's resolved.  Thanks all.

he.net fra1 tserv1 is down since about 10 minutes ago (~14:57 PT),
this time it seems like the whole thing is down, cannot even ping
ordns.he.net over IPv6; a connection of my friend who's running a
smokeping is also down, e.g. this is definitely widespread.

Not sure what's exactly down, but it seems to be bgp-related, perhaps:

I'm being told by the NOC that someone is on the ground in FRA1,
replacing a switch; and that it's a "scheduled maintenance", no ETA,
and there was no announcement, since someone has to take a flight to

35 minutes of downtime, and counting...

I'm not a network engineer, but it sounds like all specific routes for
tserv1.fra1.he.net are expired / not announced, and the default route
is taken instead.  40+ minutes so far...

This also affects some dns.he.net services; for example, from where
you normally were getting a FRA1 ns resolver, there's now no BGP
announcement, it would seem:

The /tserv1.fra1.he.net/ seems to be back up,  since ~16:41 PT, 
for a total downtime of almost 2 hours (1:49), since ~14:52 PT.

However, the routing is still a bit weird right now, going through 
London for a 20ms ping (the usual is about 6ms).

yeah the site itself seems to be having issues, like click next and it brings
up an ebay error page.  lots of stalled loads etc.

An outage is an outage. If you consider this particular outage noise then I suggest you learn how to use the filter functionality of your mail client.

Subject: [outages] FYI timestamp.verisign.com not responding
Message-ID: <CAJGHyrFfruAgmVy9nh-jQpbET-JhX78AmQrW-WXtjaMVh_VipA@mail.gmail.com>

I've been receiving reports and after testing it appears
timestamp.verisign.com is not responding.

Wanted to pass the note around in case others are trying to figure out why
tools using this service may be failing.

Resolves same IP east or west coast.

timestamp.verisign.com is an alias for timestamp.ilg.ws.symantec.net.
timestamp.ilg.ws.symantec.net has address 69.58.181.58


I don't know how far into the network this trace usually goes but here it
is anyway:

Hi,

The Akamai heat map ( http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/dataviz1.html )
is showing a 75% rise in attacks/latency in CA. Has anyone heard of
anything going on? (I'm not near a real machine so a bit difficult to
research).

Thanks, Tuc

The perceived S/N on outages seems to be dropping slightly again lately,
so please remember:

If it's a report that something appears out, a confirmation that something
is out, or an inquiry directly related to either (concerning scope or
necessary further data to confirm or deny), then it's on-topiv.

As soon as you're tempted to reply to a posting and branch off into
"and it probably wouldn't happen if they had..." or "and this happens a 
lot..." or any other such editorial comments -- and *certainly* if you are
replying to one -- you should move your reply to -discussion, CCing
the person to whom you're replying, in case they're not on that list.

And, in other news: an additional reminder that if you get a message
CCd to both you and a list you're already on anyway, it's nearly always
because the sender's email client does not have a Reply-To-List button,
as nearly all consumer MUAs do not.  (I've had a ticket open on Zimbra
for 4 years for this with no motion.)

We try to keep the list as useful as possible to as large a number of
subscribers as possible, but we understand that some audiences have
disjoint requirements; we apologize if the rules we *do* try to enforce
leave still too much traffic on the list for you.
</moderator>

And Happy Flag Day!

Cheers,

In short: no.  :-)

If you have a direct support channel, such as for an uplink connection you
pay someone for, that's whom you ought to be talking to.

If your DSL link can only talk to some sites, and your collocated cablemodem
can get to everything, that's more on topic.

If there's a single destination site you can't get to, *and you've done
some homework* that suggests it's either the target or some transit link
in between, that, too, would be good fodder for the list.

Our -- well, my :-) -- twin goals for the list are to keep informed those
people who get queries about "why can't I get to X", either from paying 
customers of their own, or from inside "customers" in their business, about
things which are known to be problematic on any given day, and, a layer down,
the hope that the people involved in the outages will get some early warning,
since in many cases, the people seeing the outage have no formal reporting
channel to tell them about it.

Hopefully that helps a bit.

[ Followups to -discuss ]

Figured out it was a local opteman outage in Sugar Grove, IL. Waiting on 
an update from Att.

Some subset of FB appears to be down for some people from some places 
for about the last 10 minutes; according to both my experience and reports
from a couple dozen people on twitter.

I'm on Sprint 4G in Tampa.  Got some error messages, and now no response
to homepage or internal links... in Chrome.   Clearing cookies and local 
storage didn't help.

Fresh login on Firefox on the same machine *did* work; I suspect a load
balancer broke, and Chrome has the IP internally cached and won't drop it.

Win7 resolves www.facebook.com to 69.171.242.27, star.c10r.facebook.com

Can't post an mtr; I'm on Windows.

Most of the things that appear to be outage reports are in other languages,
mostly South American, I think, Portuguese, Spanish...

... and see?  You write a detailed enough report, and it will come back before
you're done.

Anyway, followups to -discuss, unless your email is @facebook.com, and you
*know* what was going on.  :-)

Cheers,

Looks like Frontier having home page load issues over v4 and v6 again, this
time since 12:21 pm Central or so.  Traceroutes are the same, but I've
included fresh wget results.

It's seems Frontier Communications home page has been down over IPv4 and
IPv6 since 12:34 pm Central.  Port 80 is open over v4 and v6, just the page
doesn't load.

My Frontier DSL went down sometime around 11:30 Central.  Went to VZW card to contact support, and found page down also.  DSL modem reports PPP down.

Looks like Frontier having home page load issues over v4 and v6 again, this
time since 12:21 pm Central or so.  Traceroutes are the same, but I've
included fresh wget results.

It's seems Frontier Communications home page has been down over IPv4 and
IPv6 since 12:34 pm Central.  Port 80 is open over v4 and v6, just the page
doesn't load.

I just noticed that several of our hosted websites are not working at the
moment, and they're failing due to DNS record resolution errors. I checked
into it and they're all domain names that are using GoDaddy for name
service. Anyone else seeing this?

Yep, I am seeing the same thing here in SE Pennsylvania.

No name resolution on anything that uses GoDaddy DNS.

Hi,

I am seeing it as well. Stuff going down left and right due to this 
issue. I have been working on doing some digs with trace and stuff. 
Seems so far it seems to Godaddy who is having the issues.

Sincerely,

Mark Keymer

Looks like they might have just fixed it. Starting to see stuff work again.

Yup, a "here too".  The GoDaddy support site 
http://support.godaddy.com/system-alerts (which I'm finally able to 
resolve!) also has a vague notice of a problem:

It'd be nice if they provided a timezone, but since it is from GoDaddy 
I'm betting it is Phoenix, and then MST (which is right now the same as 
PDT).

I also agree with the other posters that service is back up as of about 
10:35 CDT.

Our entire organization and three of my other accounts are getting this
pop-up when sending a message:

Oops... a server error occurred and your email was not sent. (#793)


But, as usual, everything is "totally fine" according to the GApps status

A couple of our users, myself included, have had this happen intermittently
this morning.  Seems to work on a second attempt.

I saw it a couple of times.  I hit send a second time and it went through.
 (not certain of the error code, mind you)

My organizational GMail account was briefly having the same problem for a
few minutes around the time you sent your message, but it is back to normal
for everyone here now.

I just saw this on a draft on which I was working... I ended up copying
content, deleting draft, recomposing.  #793 was the error, but I just sent
this using Gmail ;-)

Outlook users still reporting problems and it's not as obvious how to
resend in Outlook.  Since we consider Outlook users to be redheaded
bast(COUGH) "unsupported users" I haven't dug into more details.  I told
them to start using the web UI.

Known issue, already resolved.

Keep in mind that it takes non-zero time to post updates to the status
dashboard so the statements can be checked for accuracy.

Was this related to the new certificate, or a different issue?  I also got
a (temporary) certificate error when loading Gmail in firefox this morning,
and the certificate being used was issued on the 5th of June.
