Internet in Burma/Myanmar is very strictly controlled by the "government"
(ie, the military junta who claims to be the government). From memory, all
access runs via a single connection, which then feeds through a "firewall"
which significantly restricts what can be accessed.

However as you'd expect, many people - including most Internet cafes
throughout the country - have worked out ways around this firewall.  When I
was there (~2.5 years ago) this generally consisted of using software like
"Your-Freedom" (http://www.your-freedom.net/) which tunnel the traffic to
somewhere else in the world - normally Europe.

In less than a week the country will hold the first national elections in
around 20 years.  It's no secret that these elections will be a farce, and
the "government" is seriously limiting (if not completely blocking) all
foreign media access to the country during the election.

So putting 2 and 2 together, my guess is that any Internet problems in Burma
at the moment are completely deliberate on the part of the "government" in
an effort to limit communication outside of the country.  If that's the
case, you can expect it to stay down for at least the next ~ 2 weeks, and
possibly longer.

(For those that are wondering, name change from "Burma" to "Myanmar" was
made by the junta many years ago.  As the governments of many countries
around the world do not consider the junta to be the official government of
the country, they do not recognize the change, and thus officially still use
the old name of Burma. Other countries (including the US) do recognize the
junta as the government of the country, and thus use the new name of Myanmar
- or more correctly the "Republic of the Union of Myanmar")

  Scott.

I lost a DS3 coming out of the St Louis area exactly an hour ago.  The
Qwest repair line has an automated message reporting a fiber cut in the
St Louis area.  No word on the actual cause.

This website really ought to call itself "Down for Google App Engine

Syniverse had issues with their acquired Verisign/Metcalf portion of their
intercarrier SMS messaging. So any carrier behind VSN to/from would
experience problems. AT&T and Sprint are the major two behind them. AT&T to
AT&T messages shouldn't have been affected.

More issues tonight also in SMS. Verizon had issues earlier and now Verisign
again. Don't expect instant delivery for SMS tonight.

Just an FYI - Sybase365 has a planned maintenance tonight that will affect
SMS to/from Verizon, T-Mobile, and Cricket.

It will start at 2AM Eastern Time.

I started to fill it out but as a 
out-of-work-but-still-interested-in-the-world ex-admin I really could 
not contribute much, and could not answer some of the questions honestly 
(and it seems like it nagged at me for leaving blanks).
so, I should probably be left out of the base.

I'm probably not able to give you the right sort of feedback
as I'm a freelance admin and work with a bunch of small 
operators, none of which are more than a couple racks each.

The list is useful because I can pass on operational warnings
to my customer's tech guys.

I suspect there are more than a few people here who aren't in that type of
organization, or who only have a vision of part of their company's
technical stance, or who aren't allowed to talk about all of it without
higher-level approval.  I'm in more than one of those categories myself.

I imagine there would be more responses if it was completely
anonymous.  Just the idea of having to put personal/work info into the

I run an ITSP, so much of the survey doesn't apply to me.  I'm on the 
list because some outages affect our customers and it's useful to know 
before they call.  I know there are others here who work for companies 
like mine.

I lost a circuit from Indianapolis to Chicago around 9:48, vendor
confirms Qwest has a cut between Chicago and Portage, IN that they're
still working on isolating.

I called Global Crossing for unrelated reasons and they had a

Subject: [outages] FiOS backbone overload in TPA?
Message-ID: <7548600.1142.1289441094166.JavaMail.root@benjamin.baylink.com>

I have a customer who has two sites connected by FiOS in Pinellas County,
FL -- one a new install -- and we seem to be seeing about a 7-8% packet loss
between the two.

If I flood ping from the new one to 4.2.2.1, 9 hops away, I don't drop a 
single packets.

If I flood ping from the new one to the old one, at 56 or 1024 bytes, I drop,
over any appreciable amount of time, nearly exactly the same 7% of packets.

mtr also shows (if I leave it running long enough) 7% drop to that old site,
with *zero* loss at any of the 3 other hops.

We've had the person whose install that old site is call it in... and he
tells me that his "inside guy" says there's a master ticket up in this market
about packet loss in the backbone... but my first tier guys wouldn't admit
to it.

Anybody know anything?  VoIP is singularly intolerant of packet loss...

Cheers,

Is there any actual evidence or confirmation that this is a DoS/DDoS?
Packet loss isn't necessarily an indicator of such, no matter how many
alternate paths or peers/routes you have available to you.  It could be
something as simple as "we have a core router that has gone haywire and
'Bob' hasn't come into the office yet"...

Just sayin'.

My only comment to failing DNS queries is that last night one of my  
customers who uses a remote site monitoring tools was getting alot of  
alerts that there website names weren't resolving.

We have three geographic and network diverse Auth DNS servers, so at  
the time I couldn't explain it. But if register.com was having issues,  
especially with DNS, that could be a cause.

I've confirmed that this was a DDoS attack.
They have a 24x7 NOC and redundant networking systems, but of course
redundant only goes so far.
All 6 of their name servers are responding normally for me at the moment.
I am assuming they have put counter-measures in place.

dns still seems down for www.satsig.net

Called the register.com folks in usa and told they have reset their dns servers and are awaiting dns cache timeouts to resolve problems

Any idea from anyone else most appreciated

I mentioned this to Virendra in that survey that was sent out, but why  
do we feel its important to track facebook being up or down?

I find this list to be useful in tracking major IP outages between  
transit carriers. It goes directly to my NOC pager and all my NOC  
staff, and many times it has been very useful when people post about  
an OC-48 cut for ATT, or an XO outage, then our customers call us  
about issues and we know its not us and their carrier.

I could care less whether or not Facebook is up or down. Facebook  
doesn't effect the rest of the internet like a Level3 or ATT outage,  
or or fiber cut in NYC.

If you go to facebook.com and its down, then yes, its down. End of  
story. They are an endpoint on the internet.

I'm not opposed to other sites being reported. If Google is down,  
thats big, because Google provides a ton email proxy services.  
Likewise, the post about register.com being down was very helpful  
because they provide core DNS services. These sites/networks effect  
the internet.

But facebook is meaningless from an infrastructure/operations  
standpoint, and is a complete waste of time to discuss on this list.

Some operations do depend on Facebook.

It's good to know when you're running an ISP and customers say the
Internet is down the same time you know Facebook is down.

Yeah, but you dont need the outages mailing list to determine if  
facebook is down for your ISP constituents. Just bring up a browser,  
and if its down, its down! Testing over.

Unlike an Sprint outage in Chicago, there is no easy way for me to  
test that, but a post on the list helps.

Sad as it may be, millions of people think Facebook is "the internet." 
They use it as their home page and rarely leave.  FB is now one of the 
top five search engines, because people search there, since it is "the 
internet" for them.  They use it as their e-mail, their calendar of 
events, and their contact list.

When FB dies, they call their ISP and report that the internet is down.

Facebook is not the Internet and shouldn't be used as a guideline as to
whether or not the Internet is down. I feel bad for your operations
staff if that is your mechanism to determine an outage

Customer: "I can't get to the Internet"
Support: "You're right, Facebook is down, we'll open a ticket with our
carrier..."

I wonder what someone in Level3 or Global would tell me if I called and
told them that... Anyhow, off to Best Buy, trying to find out why when I
bought this computer I didn't receive the Internet inside the box as
promised.

No.  The customer claims "the Internet is down" and the rep knows
before the call is answered that Facebook is down and has them check
another website rather then trouble shooting equipment, seeing how
things are plugged in, etc.

John,

Maybe you could put a filter in your paging scripts that looks for facebook
and junks the email so you don't get woken up for it?

You can completely solve this problem for yourself.

Write a rule that deletes anything with facebook in it.  There now you don't have to get upset.

Yeah, but you dont need the outages mailing list to determine if  
facebook is down for your ISP constituents. Just bring up a browser,  
and if its down, its down! Testing over.

Unlike an Sprint outage in Chicago, there is no easy way for me to  
test that, but a post on the list helps.

My frustration with $bigwebsite dying and this list is that I don't get 
one post about it.  I get a TON of posts with people basically saying "Me 
Too" (c) 2010 AOL.

One post that facebook is down is informative - even in the enterprise 
people will likely get questions about it.  However, everyone responding 
indicating it's down for them too is less useful.

We're talking about average Joe Q Public.

This list is for NOC people, ISP operators - not the average Joe.  
Thats my point. Why are we wasting cycles on posting facebook  
outages.  "WE" know that facebook is meaningless, and we know how to  
determine if its down on its own accord and not related to an internet  
outage with our carrier.

My point to Virendra is this list is becoming tainted with meaningless  
posts. If people post garbage all the time, it will no longer be  
useful to anyone.

So can we stop with these stupid facebook posts. Use your common sense  
when you post an outage to this list.

I could care less about a fiber cut in NYC.

Please keep your fiber cut emails to yourself, I dont find them 
appropriate for this list.

funny, facebook provides a lot more services than you (clearly) care to 
know about as well.

in my ops roll, if facebook is down (either APIs or customer interface) I 
-DO- want to know, because my job, my company, and my customers, "depend" 
on it.


just because you don't use it doesnt mean others dont.  (hence my comment 
about the fiber cuts)

Now I think this is getting off topic...

Clearly everyone's desire for being part of this list is to address varying operational needs.

Can we all accept this fact and move on?

If this is true and not just in jest, you're very much on the wrong list.

Every message that passes through this list has a footer, shown below:

> _______________________________________________

> Outages at outages.org
> https://puck.nether.net/mailman/listinfo/outages

I encourage everyone to read the above link for clarification on what
material is expected on the list. As best I can determine, "is
XYZwebsite down?" does not pass muster. There are other sites for the
latter: http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/www.facebook.com

For those who may be too busy updating their Facebook status to click
the above (or below) list description, here's the first paragraph:

"The primary goal of this mailing list ("outages") is for
outages-reporting that would apply to failures of major communications
infrastructure components having significant traffic-carrying
capacity, similar to what FCC provided prior to 9/11 days but they
seem to have pulled back due to terrorism concerns. Some also believe
that LEC's and IXC's also like this model as they no longer have to
air their dirty laundry. Then again, this mailing list is not about
making anyone look bad, its all about information sharing and keeping
network operators & end users abreast on the situation as close to
real-time information as possible in order to assess and respond to
major outage such as routing voice/data via different carriers which
may directly or indirectly impact us and our customers. A reliable
communications network is essential in times of crisis."

...though some end-users may find a Facebook outage to be a "time of
crisis," I'm fairly certain for operational purposes we can agree that
it isn't worthy of a thread here -- whether it's a thread of "Me Too!"
posts or "but it's important to ME!" posts.

Please, let's let this thread burn out and move on with our day.

In other words, 99% of the traffic on this list has always been off topic. 
When was the last time anyone reported something that actually fits that?

Global Crossing had issues yesterday in Ashburn. I wouldn't be surprised if
they are having problems somewhere else today. This was noted in the
HE/Global Crossing thread yesterday.

I expect to see traffic on "outages" that discusses Internet/telecom
infrastructure outages -- that is, fiber cuts, circuit issues, prefix
snafus, DNS botches, carrier downtime, etc.  I don't expect to see
traffic about any particular web site, *unless* that traffic is using
that web site as an example of what the problem is, or as part of a
symptom report, or to delineate the scope of a problem.  Not Facebook,
not Google, not Amazon, not eBay -- none of them are important enough
or will ever be important enough to merit the same level of concern. [1]

Now, I do get that some users out there conflate "Facebook" (or perhaps
"Google" or some other site) with "the Internet".  That's unfortunate, and
I really do feel badly for front-line personnel who must deal with these
people.  But I would rather buy those folks a good bottle of scotch so
that they can drown their troubles, and keep all that noise off here.

Because some of you have paying customers who complain (a complaint you 
want to be prepared to correct without a "wait-while-I-check", 
credibility destroying delay) that you are not providing connectivity 
you promised.

Why not go back to NANOG?

I'm getting what NANOG won't supply.

The fact is that connectivity to that domain accounts for an increasing
percentage of end user eyeball traffic and various "spin off" content.
Those in the business of delivering content to eyeballs know that
disruption of traffic to the popular content providers are a huge
complaint generator.  If someplace like twitter or facebook or google is
unreachable from the perspective of a provider's customers, they are
going to want to know "is it just me, just my region, is anyone else
having the problem" so they can get some idea of the scope of the issue
and have something to tell a customer who might ask about it.

I don't think it is so much because "it's facebook" as it is "my phones
are ringing and my customers are calling, is this my issue or a general
issue" sort of thing.

My personal opinion of a site doesn't mean anything in the context of
providing access to what they want access to.  I am not going to be more
or less active in sorting out an issue based on my opinion of the site.
Doing so is simply imposing my choices on other people.  As a provider
of end user content, that role is best reversed, the customers impose
their choices on the provider and anyone who doesn't get that isn't long
in business.

"You're" an idiot.

And gramatical issues aside, major sites like Facebook being down have
major business impact.
That which impacts your business more may or may not align with that
which impacts my business more.

We can either call this list
"outages_which_effect_john_von_essen at outages.org", or we can accept
that on a list called "outages", we will report major outages which
have far reaching impact.

major business impact.
That which impacts your business more may or may not align with that

We can either call this list

If connectivity to major content destinations are important to you, your front-line support staff, and your clients, then if you have multiple points of presence yourself monitor those from multiple points.  If not, use places like www.pingdom.com and www.websitepulse.com with global test locations to give you a broader, faster picture then writing to a mailing list and seeing if others can get to Facebook/Youtube/etc.  

The discussion is slightly different if you come to the outage list saying "Hey we are seeing issues connecting to Facebook from Europe/East coast of US, anyone have news on fiber outages, etc."  Then simply opening a discussion with "facebook seems down, anyone else?" as there are free tools, even at both of the mentioned above, and more are out there, that you could use to test if a site is available, and those tests are real-time and free...

We use 3 different 3rd party monitoring systems using global points to test major points in our network infrastructure along with certain key client sites, and a "sample" site on each of our web clusters.  This gives us the reference point so when a client calls saying "My web site is down" we are not simply looking at local monitoring and saying "yup its all up"  As we can show the client that global locations have no issues accessing them, or that we are seeing issues through a certain region and are investigating, you know on lists like this to see if there are any major fiber cuts reported anywhere...

Thousands of companies rely on Facebook's uptime for income.  You might call
Facebook pointless, but I'm not sure Zynga agrees with that assessment.

Facebook is pointless *for you*.  to Zynga's NOC team, probably less so.
 Let's not pretend it's pointless for everyone, from irate customers who
call ISP's complaining that the "internet" is down, to people who use
Facebook as a contact list/promotional tool/calendar, all the way up to
multi-million dollar corporations who base a large portion of their revenue
stream on Facebook's uptime.

Far more time has been spent debating the merit of posting about Facebook
than I've ever spent deleting emails with Facebook in the title, and far
more time than it would have taken to create an email to filter out facebook
messages from this list.  We are, after all, NOC people and ISP operators,
so we have the ability to determine what's important for each and every one
of us.  Facebook's status may not be important enough for you or I to read
about, but I don't feel the need to dictate its level of importance to
others.

Because it is a major portal site used by a large number of people.

Case in point, a few years ago, Yahoo suffered a DDoS attack and was for
all practical purposes unreachable.  "So what, not important"?

Well, it turns out that a substantial number of our customers had Yahoo
set to their home page.  So our support desk was clobbered with calls
(and emails, funny...) thinking that *WE* or *the Internet* was down.

It's also very useful when customers call about issues like Facebook
being down and we know it's not us.

You and I know that. To a not so insignificant number of our customers,
Facebook, Yahoo, MSN, EBay, or Google are "the Internet" as far as they
know.

Not completely, IMHO.  I grant you that not every website out there
having a hiccup is worth discussing here.  On the other hand, if there's
a fiber cut completely severing all connectivity to Papua New Guinea and
I don't have any customers there or anyone trying to reach them I don't
particularly rate it high on my individual radar even though it's
infrastructure and an entire country.  So if it's reported with an
accurate subject line I'll skip the notice.  I won't complain that I
don't want to see it here because it doesn't affect me or any of my
customers.

I agree that Facebook is meaningless from an infrastructure standpoint
but disagree that it is meaningless from an operations standpoint.

Seconded.  And if it's not meaningless to your operations, it is to
many others'.

We can be slightly inclusive here, for sites which are well enough
known that an outage will be Big News, or we can split the list into a
bunch of sublists which only contain certain types of outages,
segregating it so that people who really only truly care about fiber
and routing can only get fiber and routing outages.  The bandwidth of
discussion for the non-net/infrastructure stuff is low enough that
it's not worth getting worked up about and splitting things, for me.

Your mileage may vary, but we've now wasted more bandwidth on list
arguing about Facebook being relevant than we actually have had
notifications of website outages over the last year-ish, so I think
that the point of diminishing returns has vanished behind us in the
mirror.  If those who object want an infrastructure-only outages list,
please propose one.  Or apply mail filtering or the D key.

If facebook made a major bad BGP route announcement and wreaked havoc across a bunch of peers, I would see it as more relevant. Or if a DDOS impacted one of their upstream providers.

Anyone else hear of a Comcast fiber cut in Chicago? Our monitoring is

Hmm, we had customers calling from Southeast Michigan complaining about 
slow access and at times high latency via one of our peers which happens 
to be level3.

It appears problem went away when we looked early afternoon about 
12:30pm PST.

We're peered w/ level(3) in southeast michigan and didn't notice anything unusual.

There was all kinds of press coverage about the outage, but not a lot of
technical detail.  

Based on reports, Comcast Internet customers in Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Maryland, Virginia, New York, New Hampshire, and parts of Washington, D.C.
were without access their DNS server(s) from about 8:30 pm Eastern to 11:30
pm Eastern, though some say it started as early at 8 pm and ended after
midnight.  NBC was told by a Comcast technician that outages were spread out
over six states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.  Comcast said that phone
and CATV customers were not affected.

According to published reports, Comcast was performing regular maintenance
on their DNS servers and something went wrong.  A Comcast spokesman said on
Monday that "Last night, our engineers identified a server issue that was
affecting Internet service in Boston, parts of New England and the
DC/Beltway areas".

Comcast did not share how many customers were affected.

BTW, did anyone look at http://dns.comcast.net/status.php during this
outage?

Regards,

Frank

Reading material for those who are interested, but no technical
explanation given either (not surprising; outages like this are often
kept quiet for some time while the company tries to figure out what
happened, why, and get impacted customer counts).

http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Comcast-Suffers-Major-East-Coast-Outage-111568

Depending on Comcast's infrastructure and the nature of the failure (I'm
on the west coast and witnessed nothing), it might not be possible to
determine the number of impacted customers.  For example, if I shut off
one of our primary nameservers (powered it down, shut down named/BIND,
etc.) I'd have no idea how many people were "impacted"; I'd have to
speculate based on the number of queries seen against the secondary.

Anyway, all the what-ifs should probably be discussed on outages-discuss
and not here, but I just wanted to throw that out there.
