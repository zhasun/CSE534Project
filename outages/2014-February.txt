Apparently a major power outage (even though Equinix is making the claim that no one is affected)

Our equipment on the 8th floor has been powerless for several hours.

We are being told there was a commercial power outage due to weather and
the UPS did not take the load.  However, commercial power has been restored
and they are continuing to work on the UPS to determine the issue.

More details would be appreciated.

As a customer with working equipment there, the Equinix DA3 power is up;
only their chillers are being "manually" controlled.

If there are power issues for other occupants in the Infomart building,
it's not the DA3 or any Equinix power, but that of Infomart facility itself.

Equinix told us that our services were possibly impacted at 6:14 AM due to power issues, maybe they are not fully aware of the scope of the problem?

We have equipment in the 9th floor building MMR at 165 Halsey, Newark.

We didn't see any power loss ourselves.  But...

We have interfloor fiber connections to several customers in Equinix's 8th floor facility.

At 06:08 AM EST these went down, indicating multiple 8th floor locations losing power.

Simultaneously, Cogent experienced a problem at 165 Halsey with "isolated equipment".

We have a bgp session with a Cogent router on the 9th floor and, around 06:08, the
number of prefixes they were announcing to us dropped from over 400K to 300-some.

Possibly Cogent's path out of the building depends on something within Equinix.

The customers we have on the 8th floor got their power restored around 08:55.

I'm not sure what time Cogent returned to normal, but it was some time ago.

FWIW, we've not noticed any power interruptions on the 7th floor in the Level 3 expanded colo space. We have some waves via Zayo which have remained solid as well. I assume they terminate in ZColo space somewhere in the building.

Works here (thee different AS, two in France, one in the USA).

Any good reason for violating the rule "Thou shalt always post
dig/ping/traceroute outputs with all reports 'something does not

Hi James,

Can you share more details? Location specific? what yahoo domain?
Is this OpenDNS specific or any resolver?

Just as an fyi, you can always check here:
http://cachecheck.opendns.com/

And this will tell you which OpenDNS location you're using (this show 
instance 7 in Amsterdam):

andree at blurp:~$ dig  +short txt debug.opendns.com @208.67.222.222
"server 7.ams"
"flags 20 0 2f4 800000000000000"
"id 0"
"source 213.19.146.51:52733"

Cheers,
  Andree

Only affected my $SPAM e-mail account.

Failed this morning around 1000-1100PST, from AS12182.

Unknown Host
Description: Unable to locate the server named "mg5.real.mail.yahoo.com" --- the server does not have a DNS entry. Perhaps there is a misspelling in the server name, or the server no longer exists. Double-check the name and try again. 

After we returned from lunch, reload in browswer now shows all 
is OK.

Could be unrelated noise, but two of four the test IPv6 nodes I monitor at
Yahoo had timeouts: 

*         12:18 to 1:06 pm Central

*         2:41 to 2:42 pm Central

*         3:47 to 3:48 pm Central

 

Typically they're pretty solid.  But like I wrote, could be totally
unrelated noise.

While that error is happening, you can use this link to view the page:
http://wiki.outages.org/index.php?title=Power_outage_maps&oldid=7784146

After some clicking on "Random page", it appears that the wiki database is
filled with spam pages, which is proved by

Hi Eric -

It appears that object cache table is full, maybe spam related.

Will address it as s short term fix. Looking at transitioning off to 
another server (VM) w/ tighter knobs.

Why not sending the output of tests done with dig, next time? You
would not report a routing problem without posting traceroute's
results.

We have successfully added storage to the server to avoid filling of the 
disk space. We have cleaned the spam that was causing the issue and have 
taken a new snapshot of the databases to lock it down from spam.

I will circle back with another update when the entire cleanup up is 
complete.

Yes. We've also opened a ticket but haven't yet received confirmation of any

Message-ID: <B6FB0B5B-E642-4285-BC9F-28CE5C5FAC0E@hodge.com>

We are seeing lots of problems with our audio streaming traffic dropping lots of packets where our transit provider Cogent hands off to ATT & Verizon.

Right now, I'm seeing  43% packet loss

Cogent is blaming ATT/Verizon and says there is nothing they can do about it. We're the collateral damage.

Who else is having the same issue?

I threaten to cancel my service, Cogent says, "sorry to lose you as a customer", and go on their merry way.

Are other transit providers having issues peering / getting to ATT/Verizon? I need to know who to avoid.

I'm seeing anywhere from 7-33% packet loss on cognet n phoenix to your
destination.  It averages around 9% though, Most of the packet loss happens
on the last run before it hits verizon.

Isn't this the result of VZ/Comcast/ATT and others refusing peering with Netflix and Netflix purchasing transit via Cogent to reach them?

That standoff has been going on for some time, and I would guess with the recent court ruling regarding "net neutrality", it's not going to get better until Netflix pays VZ and other large eyeball networks to carry their traffic (or pays twice, depending on your perspective).

Its more complicated than that - Netflix pays CDNs, transits etc for
delivery of much of its content.

The original email as I understood was a user seeing packet loss between
their business Internet service with Verizon and either a server hosted
within Cogent or another Internet access service. ie an end user trying to
connect with another end user/host. As such I don't think its about
Netflix, but this end user who is paying two providers neither of which are
delivering.

I would complain to both. I'd also try moving - preferably at both sides.

So far, Zayo has given no update to us and claims that there is no ETA/ETR
on the parent ticket.
The rumor mill is suggesting that a customer of theirs is suffering a large
NTP amplification DDOS.

Issues for us started at around 1:44pm (-0800).

We still observe traffic blackholing or routing loops occasionally, it
lasts for ~10min and then it comes right back for 20 - 45min.
I've just shutdown Abovenet/Zayo BGP sessions for now.

Cheers,
jof

It's very hard to discern something useful from these single sets of
mtrs because ICMP deprioritisation has become so commonplace**.  For
example (going off gut feeling), in the 2nd mtr above, I'd say that the
NTT/Verio hop (#5) is probably ICMP deprio, while subsequent loss is
probably real.

Also, 23.30.206.94 lives within Comcast IP space, but it's impossible to
know what company (Verizon or Comcast) is responsible for it.

** -- Folks often forget that even when using classic UDP traceroute,
ICMP is still involved (specifically time exceeded).

This happened 1/21/14 from 12:40 PST - 14:15 PST as well.. I wonder if it's
the same customer under attack which seems to cripple parts of their bay
area network. Under Above.net we received excellent information about
network events, under Zayo is has not been the same experience.

Last time we reached out to Zayo it took over a month. This is just sales
and not any incident regarding service. Stop enabling bad service.

I think this is the only language Cogent understands.

If someone is singlehomed to Cogent, and their connectivity sucks, it's 
their provider's (= Cogent's) job to fix the issue.  Not use that as a
lever to extort money from other ISPs.

The point is that Cogent is doing a fairly aggressive "we de-peer you,
and then we try to sell you transit traffic" strategy.  Some people
follow suit, some people refused to be blackmailed that way, and send
the traffic to their upstreams.

Next thing, the interconnect between those upstreams and Cogent fills 
up (surprise), and Cogent refuses to upgrade (because they want to sell
bandwidth, no matter how much collateral damage they do to get there).

At least *we* are not going to support this business model, and we 
encourage everyone else to also vote with their money.


We happily pay large gobs of money to our upstream providers who do not
try to play silly peering power games to the disadvantage of their customers
(positive counterexample that we're very happy to give money to: NTT).

FYI- This is the form letter that Cogent is sending to anyone who opens a ticket about the issues with Verizon. I'm starting to get a collection of them.



Dear Cogent Customer,

The latency and/or packet loss that you are experiencing to this destination is due to high traffic from one of our peers with Verizon. We have reached out to Verizon to request assistance resolving the amount of traffic they are sending on this peer and are awaiting their response. We will continue to reach out to them until they respond.

If you have any further questions please feel free to contact us by e-mail at support at cogentco.com or by phone at 877-7COGENT (877-726-4368).

Thank You,

Cogent Communications

And VZ wants some payment from Netflix as well - most likely by selling Netflix transit I suppose.

As such I don't think its about Netflix, but this end user who is paying two providers neither of which are delivering.

Netflix's overall traffic volume is huge.  If Cogent is in fact the path of last resort to Verizon for Netflix, and VZ and Cogent are having a spat, this would obviously impact everyone looking to move traffic between VZ and Cogent, not just Netflix customers.

> I would complain to both. I'd also try moving - preferably at both sides.

On the residential side, you have a duopoly if you're lucky, moving isn't an option for everyone.  And if Comcast is also having issues, then you've exhausted both of your options (cable and FiOS).

Total speculation, but seeing the complaints from FiOS users about Netflix, Youtube and Amazon makes me think VZ is really itching to test the new court ruling.  All three of those "problem networks" have great peering terms, yet VZ, from what I can see does not peer with any of them.  On our network, I see more than 50% of our traffic lands on Google or Amazon - as an ISP, it's pretty bold to decide to reach those networks via anything but a peering relationship.

Fully agree with the concerns against VZ (altho don't blame on maligned
intent what can be explained through incompetence either).

On the other hand, Netflix have a choice of upstreams and CDNs and Cogent
doesn't have to accept business that it can't fulfill. It could also
mitigate against the service problems that other customers see in the same
way anyone deals with a DDoS affecting their peers ie throttle, reduce the
problem traffic.

Hence why, I would where possible, move to more responsible providers who
don't still think its the 1990s and that "Tier1s" are the core of the
Internet (as you point out out content is > 50% of the Internet and is the
network core of the 2010s).

We have been collateral damage in this fight for a long time too, we
adjusted our routing for a VZN traffic to transit our US Signal link to
resolve this issue.

This is what they are sending when you open a ticket about att:

Dear Cogent Customer,

The latency and/or packet loss that you are experiencing to this 
destination
is due to occasional high traffic with ATT. We have repeatedly requested
augments to these congestion points and hope ATT will comply soon.  
While
this has been escalated internally to the CEO level, we encourage you to
also contact ATT customer support with your concerns and complaints.  
Their
delay is a major impediment to internet traffic overall and contrary to 
net
neutrality requirements.  Our peering engineers will continue to address
this on a daily basis until resolved.

If you have any further questions please feel free to contact us by 
e-mail
at support at cogentco.com or by phone at 877-7COGENT (877-726-4368).

Thank You,

Cogent Communications
T 877.726.4368, option 2
F 202.295.9061



Also there were issues between level3 and att, we managed to get Level3 
to shuffle around the traffic a bit, as the peering connections were 
running at 100%+ as well, this made things better, but supposedly things 
are still pretty much full though.

Here's another response re: Verizon:

The issue on this peer involves a high amount of traffic being sent to Cogent from the Verizon network. In order to resolve the congestion on that peer, Verizon needs to engineer thier routing to another peering point with Cogent that has more available space for the traffic. We have reached out to Verizon for assistance and are still awaiting a response from their peering engineers. We will continue to reach out to them until they respond.

And here's what they say about Qwest/CenturyLink - note this is verbatim 
from a response received today - missing words and all:

Dear Cogent Customer,

  The latency and/or packet loss that you are experiencing to this destination is due to high traffic with Qwest.

   The peering connection between Cogent and  has been escalated within our Senior Management. Our Peering department is actively working with  to add more capacity  as quickly as possible. While Cogent is prepared to commit additional capacity, we are still pending  to complete their planning and provisioning process under the free peering agreement. Due to the nature of this process, we cannot determine an estimated time for this to be completed.

It could be tangential or even totally unrelated, but we were notified by
Fox this afternoon that their TV Everywhere authentication was having some
issues this afternoon.

I have been told from people within Cogent that they keep hounding upper
management, but they are doing nothing about the problems.  I can see how
dealing with Verizon or ATT could be difficult, but if you are in the
business of providing a service, fixing the problem is your
responsibility. Hence why we have moved away from Cogent.

A lot of the issues I saw at customers seemed to be with older
hardware/software combinations not handling the # of communities.
Yesterday, it was a few prefixes (/22s from AS 50010) and today another from
the same AS.  The smaller gear choked and bounced sessions.   I didn't see
any of this with larger iron and newer software.

Just got confirmation from Internap NOC that they are being attacked again.

Causing quite a bit of chaos for my network in SoCal.

I'm having to route over to Level3 to minimize the issue.

*grumble*  I wonder if that's what's causing the
NANOG video stream to be choppy?  I know
Internap is providing the connectivity for the
conference.  If so, I sure wish the attackers
would have waited one more day.  :(

Close your NTP amplifiers and prevent the spoofing.. Will solve this one.

To second Jared on this one, we?ve seen a HUGE increase in NTP-based attacks over the past several weeks with our colo customers. It?s very efficient too ? even a pretty low end machine can saturate a 100M link. It reminds me of SQL slammer?

Good info, I?ll definitely be looking into this.

But, I?m not being directly attacked. Internap is one of my upstreams, and they are the one that reported that they were being attacked when we called to let them know about the problem.

It?s the other way around though isn?t it? If your NTP servers are vulnerable then you?re assisting in the attack as your NTP servers are being used to attack the victim. 

Though I imagine that if your NTP servers were being used you?d bee seeing a large spike in your outbound UDP traffic.

I see some attributes in the "UNIX ntpd" example there which are
missing.  I would suggest people follow the defaults provided by some of
the OSS distros (ex. FreeBSD 9):

http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/stable/9/etc/ntp.conf?revision=259974&view=markup

Specifically these lines for starters:

restrict default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery
restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery

restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict -6 ::1
restrict 127.127.1.0

The last 3 lines are effectively "allow" statements.  You'll
need to modify your ntp.conf accordingly; e.g. if the system in
question is used as an NTP server for other machines on 192.168.1.0/24,
you'd need something like:

restrict 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0

But I recommend folks read (not skim -- it actually reads quite easily,
just the formatting isn't easily skimmable) the following page, as it
goes over the difference between "restrict default {bunch of modifiers}"
vs. "restrict default ignore":

http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/AccessRestrictions

It's remarkable how neglected NTP is as a service.  :/

Only use "kod" if you also use "limited":

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1048196

"The current default restrict line in ntp.conf is:
restrict default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery

This can be confusing as the kod option is active only when the
limited options is also present. This is documented in ntp_acc(5) man
page.

The upcoming ntp-4.2.8 will warn about this and we probably want to
avoid getting that warning in the future.

http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2060

The fix is to remove kod from the default restrict line."

Hi Jeremy,

Being the original author of the template with some contributions from
others, I'll simply note that we are aware of some of these other
options and are considering changes.  We just received some additional
suggestions about another part of the template today.  Earlier we had
received somewhat conflicting advice from two people both associated
with the ntp.org project, though easily reconcilable.  :-)

I think what we're going to do is highlight some of these
seemingly different suggestions by offering more detailed
discussion about the options and make it easier for people to
tune it to local conditions and preference.

Thanks for your comments here, this is a helpful discussion for
us as well.

John

Massive Level 3 issues again. Got this from them:



The IP NOC has detected Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on various network
routers in Houston, TX. The IP NOC is analyzing the routing protocol
session failures to determine the next course of action.



IP NOC and Security Ops are working on resolving the BGP sessions failures

It seems that www.openssl.org is down.

# nslookup www.openssl.org

Server:         8.8.8.8

** server can't find www.openssl.org: NXDOMAIN

openssl.org redirects to www.openssl.org which doesn't help. The IP must be
different for openssl.org and www.openssl.org too since adding
194.97.152.144 www.openssl.org causes a redirect loop.

nslookup is a very poor DNS diagnostic tool. The problem is that
www.openssl.org is an alias to openssl.net and openssl.net is
(stupidly) served by only one name server, which is currently down.

We saw similar issues with Level3 at Switch SuperNAP in Las Vegas.

Last we heard:
Level-3 IP NOC Team and Security Ops are applying filters on affected routers to re-establish routing sessions and restore normal operations but they have not provided any ETR as of now.

*** CASCADED EXTERNAL NOTES 13-Feb-2014 09:07:11 GMT From CASE: 7538219 -
Event Security Ops attempted to apply filters on the network routers to
reject the IP traffic of the DDoS attacks.  However, the filters were
unsuccessful due to the multiple sources of the attack.  Security is
attempting another plan to limit the effect of the attack on the targeted
destination of the DDoS attack.

Final notes from them. Any one still seeing issues? My direct level 3
circuits look good on a spot check. Still having issues with a ISP that has
Level 3 as their only major upstream

*** CASCADED EXTERNAL NOTES 13-Feb-2014 10:32:49 GMT From CASE: 7538219 -
Event A packet loss issue impacted IP Services across multiple markets in
the North America. The Technical Service Center worked with the IP NOC to
develop a configuration change to a larger group of customers to expedite
restoration. After the configuration change was run, teams validated the
deployment success to ensure stability. The Operations Engineering team
reported that the configuration change that was developed was successful in
resolving the packet loss issue. It was communicated that the issue has
resolved and services have restored. If additional issues are experienced,
please contact the Level 3 Technical Service Center.

Their DNS is broken - www.webex.com and other hosts in that domain are not
resolving for me.

Webex'es in progress appear to still be working, but with severe
performance problems for about the past ~15-20 minutes.

$ nslookup www.webex.com 8.8.8.8
Server:         8.8.8.8

Looks to be back now, pending DNS caches caching the NXDOMAIN longer than
the 2 minutes in the SOA.

I think that may be a problem at your end, since resolution works just
fine for me here on at least some of their authoritative name servers.
(There seemed to be timeout problems on some of them, which makes me
think they mighta had a problem earlier.)  At the same time, given
that www.webex.com turns out to be a three-layer CNAME chain, just
about anything could be the problem here (and I didn't chase all the
alternatives).

[OT for outages, and FWIW, I will note that using nslookup for
troubleshooting the DNS is as likely as not to lead you astray.  I
stronly suggest you find a new tool.  Dig and drill are both free and
considerably better.  (Also, testing a recursive nameserver's
responses is useful, especially when it's 6% of the Internet.  But
that means that _someone's_ DNS is broken, not necessarily the
authoritative's.)]

The fact that the original poster in the thread stated that Webex had
confirmed that their service was "down for everyone" probably means that it
was a little more than just my DNS that was broken. The reason it's working
for you know is that the problem appears to have been resolved >10 minutes
before your response.

FWIW (all commands run during the outage) :

$ dig +trace www.webex.com

Right now from here, dig + trace for openssl.net is showing problems.

m.root-servers.net show the ns servers to be

ns6.gandi.net
ns1.openssl.com
dns1.indithosting.net
dns2.indithosting.net

I am not getting answers from ns6.gandi.net sometimes.  Oops a 
traceroute shows my traffic goes through Level3.  So I can forgive that 
right now.

But...

You get different NS servers from different servers hosting openssl.net  
dns2.indithosting.net is reporting the zone's NS servers as:

dns1.indithosting.net  through dns5.indihosting.net
ns1.openssl.com

and sometimes ns6.gandi.net, but not always.  Confusing at best.

Update:  Cooling issues at 1250 Rene.  Site-wide.  Not sure if our gear overheated and went down or if they are randomly shutting off breakers or if breakers are tripping due to the heat.

Standard[1] Monday[2] Reminder[3]:

DDOS attacks are bad.  DDOS attacks that you can't tell where they're coming
from are worse.  BCP38 helps eliminate the latter, which helps markedly with 
the former.  BCP38 is usually relatively easy to implement.

Most of you people know how to do it already, and we'd really like your help
in teaching the rest.

  http://www.bcp38.info

If you know something, write something[4].


Cheers,
-- jra

[1] Until we move 75% up to like 95%, at least.
[2] Unless I forget.
[3] And apparently we need one; 3 Really Smart Guys *including Ferg* posted
on BCP38 this morning, and none promoted the page.
[4] Slogan stolen from a much stupider Security Theatre And Paranoia slogan

Anyone seeing Level3 routing issues?  We just observed a massive drop in

backbone in terms of traceroutes along their backbone.  They might be
adding some filters based on the recent DDOS attacks, I can ping
interfaces but traceroutes go to hell...

Maybe related to the Level3 BGP discussion from moments ago?

Seems to be nationwide?

Working from East Texas, although the initial connection to load the page is a bit sluggish.

Level3 NOC confirms that the issue was localized to a Charlotte router.

Page and site load but the actual functions that appear to be run by their
backend stopped working at 9am-ish EST (such as confirming seats, etc.)

But alas this does not look at all like a Level3 or inter-tubes issue...
Just a broken airline computer system.



Looks like some airports ground to a halt, I?m sure there will be a media
story about it soon enough.

Anyone seeing Level3 routing issues? We just observed a massive drop in
routes in the BGP feeds and seeing some strange ICMP issues along their
backbone in terms of traceroutes along their backbone. They might be
adding some filters based on the recent DDOS attacks, I can ping
interfaces but traceroutes go to hell...

the ip is 54.236.190.113

that seems like a pretty high latency to seattle and some packet loss.

54.236.190.113 lands me in the east coast it seems. IE. All my west coast 
boxes go east, And my East Coast boxes go north. Toward NY/WDC? Same with 
72.21.222.35.

Also, Remember. Mid-traceroute loss that doesn't continue to the end isn't 
a valid indication of Packet Loss.

Control-plane loss != forwarding-plane loss.

Subject: [outages] Heavy nLayer packet loss out of Chicago
Message-ID: <CAHDg04uPaMuwBKX4+rft2GcoXJ7hgJi5XpGMq+QPBZeraw_QbA@mail.gmail.com>

Don't have traces I can show and I've routed my networks around the
issues anyway but looks like nLayer getting out of Chicago is seeing
really high packet loss.  (Possibly at a hand off to XO?)  I've routed
my networks around it so can't actually provide trace endpoints and
the one traceroute I started is all mucked up as I pulled the transit
while waiting for it to finish.

Today, I have:

Latency is up roughly 100%; however, packet loss is staying at 0%.

Yup, we saw a major spike in RTTs on our DSL service in downtown Fargo too.

Everything is back to normal for us now (04:31 UTC).

Starting to clear up here. Was seeing CenturyLink staring with packetloss 
 >30% and then saw the same on L3 and Cogent. Internet Pulse also notes 
multiple points with problems. Just started seeing issues about 30 minutes 
ago, so not sure it's related - or very delayed reaction... ;)

Yes. Looks like an attack of some sort. I'd post a link to their status
update page, but it's (unwisely) on the same network and domain as their
own service.

Message-ID: <CC75EEBF17C7374EA8309102B7B10C84012D607E99@exchange.shenrons-house.local>

Knowing this is kind of vague... I had about 15 complaints this morning about 09:00 GMT of various customers having connectivity issues to various places.  The only thing I can trace out as a common denominator is that there was extensive packet loss at a couple of nlayer routers on the west coast US.  Anyone else see something like this or know of anything else going on I might have missed?  As examples I as 45+% packet loss going into an nlayer device in Los Angeles, and about 30% going to a final destination in Arizona.

Thanks,
Blake

Undersea fiber cut between uk and amsterdam.    nlayer master ticket: 80733

We're seeing a lot of NL<->US<->UK re-routing that is clogging up
transatlantic and even nyc routers as well as any western european
connectivity.

What about either of these traceroutes (the one you provided, or the one
Dj Padzensky provided) indicates, quote, "traffic routing all over the
place?"

The multipathing/balancing (within NTT/Verio) seen in Dj Padzensky's
traceroute looks quite normal to me.

And all of this is only half the picture -- a traceroute from
205.251.242.54 going back to wherever you are would be helpful (but I
know it's doubtful either of you can provide that).  Asymmetric routing
is commonplace.

Am in Colorado on CenturyLink DSL. When I try and trace to www.amazon.com, 
it fails:

But the web site comes up fine in my browser. Checked IPs and tried with 
that and still the same - site comes up fine but trace and pings fail at CTL:

I was doing traceroutes on Dnsstuff and one of my employees did one on
another website and mine where showing to be going to the UK, and his went
to Malaysia or somewhere in that realm and then back to Washington.

What about either of these traceroutes (the one you provided, or the one Dj
Padzensky provided) indicates, quote, "traffic routing all over the place?"

The multipathing/balancing (within NTT/Verio) seen in Dj Padzensky's
traceroute looks quite normal to me.

And all of this is only half the picture -- a traceroute from
205.251.242.54 going back to wherever you are would be helpful (but I know
it's doubtful either of you can provide that).  Asymmetric routing is
commonplace.

What you're seeing is commonplace too.

I would say both ICMP TTL exceeded (used for route/path discovery) and
ECHO/ECHO REPLY look to be filtered at border routers, probably border
routers that Amazon owns/maintains.  While mtr by default uses ICMP
exclusively, ICMP TTL exceeded is still used for path discovery, hence
people thinking "there must be something wrong".

mtr does have a -T flag that uses TCP SYN instead of ICMP ECHO for
endpoint reachability, i.e. mtr -T -P 80 www.amazon.com, but all it does
for me on FreeBSD is bail out with a hard-to-read error ("bind(): No
error: 0") and doesn't reset tty params on failure, resulting in a
wonderful mess of a terminal (requires "stty icanon isig iexten echo
icrnl ixon brkint onlcr" be run before things begin behaving again).

But traceroute -P tcp -p 80 www.amazon.com doesn't improve things
either, going back to my theory that TTL exceeded is probably filtered.

Testing end-to-end like you did (in a browser, telnet port 80, etc.)
is one of the only things one can do in this situation.

<cry>
I love how network admins still to this day filter all this, making
troubleshooting virtually impossible.  The mentality I find hilarious;
"if we permit it, someone could ping -f the router's IP that responds
to TTL exceeded and cause high CPU" -- and if that doesn't work, guess
what the packet kids do?  Send 200gbit/sec of traffic at your uplink,
effectively accomplishing the same result of knocking you offline.

And no I will not respond to commentaries about this section of my mail.

The main problem we were seeing is that the main page would only partially
load, and you could not browse to other pages. Although it does seem to be
working much better now.

Evening -

Any SP aware of a maintenance event taking place between Bremen Georgia and
Carrollton Georgia, affecting multiple 10G circuits on our network as well
as Earthlink and a few other carriers to include Google's primary in/out of
Atlanta?

Licensed to us as "ring protected", however, as a result of this outage,
come to find out this appears to be configured as a collapsed ring.

Thank you kindly for any information anyone may be able to provide.

Message-ID: <C58A9C61-251D-4660-B1AD-AC34D29B53BF@telephonic.ca>

Peer1?s core NOC (1.877.504.0091) confirms network wide ?routing issues?.

All of our IPs in Vancouver were unreachable for approximately 29 minutes.  Other cities were also offline. 

Is anyone using Peer1 still offline?

Anyone seeing Level3 routing issues? We just observed a massive drop in
routes in the BGP feeds and seeing some strange ICMP issues along their
backbone in terms of traceroutes along their backbone. They might be
adding some filters based on the recent DDOS attacks, I can ping
interfaces but traceroutes go to hell...

As always, trace routes are helpful. We've been having intermittent issue with Level 3 routes for the past couple weeks, most issue for us seem to be when going from Level 3 to Global Crossing routes.

We've been having issues in San Jose the past two days on both L3 MPLS and
Internet circuits. MPLS was resolved yesterday with these notes: 

 

"Event The IP NOC advised that troubleshooting is ongoing with the equipment
vendor to further isolate the point of failure. Additionally, it has been
advised that voice services are impacted and calls are failing network wide.
Collaborative troubleshooting efforts between the IP and Voice NOC and the
equipment vendor will continue in an effort to expedite service restoral."

 

However, we're still having internet issues.

That's what we told our customer... by the time they replied, the issue had
gone away.

As always, trace routes are helpful. We've been having intermittent issue
with Level 3 routes for the past couple weeks, most issue for us seem to be
when going from Level 3 to Global Crossing routes.

We had a report from a customer earlier this morning, but they advised the
problem went away.

We connect to Level3 at Southfield MI.

Anyone seeing Level3 routing issues? We just observed a massive drop in

routes in the BGP feeds and seeing some strange ICMP issues along their

backbone in terms of traceroutes along their backbone. They might be

adding some filters based on the recent DDOS attacks, I can ping

interfaces but traceroutes go to hell...

We got a report from a client that inbound calls to only one of their blocks are not working. What's strange is we have only been able to recreate it from AT&T. Calls from Sprint are being delivered.

Anyone else experiencing this and can explain why this would happen?

Client claims Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T can't reach their block. Yet I can.

It wouldn't happen to be 650-239-xxxx in CA would it?  We are receiving reports of VZ Wireless subscribers not being able to call that exchange and it is predominately assigned to Pac West.  I just happen to have several numbers in that exchanged ported in to my network that are filing the complaints.  The numbers were ported from Pac West.

This scenario typically occurs when there are capacity issues between the
affected carrier and PacWest. Perhaps a circuit is down somewhere or there
is an abnormally high call volume between AT&T and PacWest in a given area.
This seems logical given that you said calls originating from Sprint are
fine.

PacWest is our primary origination carrier and we have not had any reports
of this today. Must be an isolated issue.

We got a report from a client that inbound calls to only one of their
blocks are not working. What's strange is we have only been able to
recreate it from AT&T. Calls from Sprint are being delivered.



Anyone else experiencing this and can explain why this would happen?



Client claims Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T can't reach their block. Yet I can.

We confirmed with PacWest they had a failure on a piece of equipment. It only impacted some areas.

They got It back up fairly quickly.

Customers received a busy signal during the period of impact.

Subject: [outages] Connectivity issue to BVI?
Message-ID: <003101cf3412$a0bb7850$e23268f0$@iname.com>

Our email server is reporting it can't send email to several domains that
reside on 208.91.197.241.  That IP address is associated with
208.91.196.0/23, which is Confluence Networks, which appears to be based in
the BVI.

A traceroute shows it stopping in Houston with Cogent.

Is there an issue with connectivity to the BVI?

Noticed that it was not reachable this morning, just tried and still broken.

www.meetup.com resolved to a single Cogent IP address (38.123.132.30) but seems it has been changed to several Cloudflare addresses now, possibly under duress.

It looks like Cloudflare has some kind of front end to the site that's
supposed to re-direct me to the actual site, but that's not working.

We're working with eNomCentral, which is our domain registrar and hosted DNS provider, on a DNS resolution issue.

They reported that the issue seems to be with multiple IPSs and are looking into  this issue.

Anyone else seen issues with DNS resolution out there this morning (morning PST time...)

Thanks

'IPSes' or ISPs?

Any details as to domains, etc.?

Sorry, typo.

ISPs ~ Internet Service Providers.

So far a few of our remote locations on the east coast, once they stopped using their ISPs DNS (one of them being Comcast) and changed to Google's 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 or L3's 4.2.2.2/4.2.2.3 they are no longer having issues resolving FQDNs hosted by eNomCentral.

'IPSes' or ISPs?

Any details as to domains, etc.?

So, the report is "some clients using ISP customer resolver servers in
various places may be having trouble resolving domains where zone service
is provided by eNom; clients using Google and L3 resolvers which had the
problem no longer see it after switching"?

Yes, spot on.

The way that eNom support reported the issue, sounded that it could be a larger issue. That was my reasoning for mailing this list.

Next time I'll gather more details and do a better job of communicating :-) Avoiding to spam the list, sorry.

Seems to be working again, seems they have the Cloudflare traffic scrubbing up and running. Via twitter they say there may still be intermittent issues.

We've also see increased packet loss and latency over the past week or so from our London Level3 office to our Verizon offices in NY and LA.  Routes to our ATT office in Chicago have been okay for the most part.

Here's a current trace from London to LAX.  Heavy packet loss in London.  It was in Paris before that :)

We've been having issues in San Jose the past two days on both L3 MPLS and Internet circuits. MPLS was resolved yesterday with these notes:



"Event The IP NOC advised that troubleshooting is ongoing with the equipment vendor to further isolate the point of failure. Additionally, it has been advised that voice services are impacted and calls are failing network wide. Collaborative troubleshooting efforts between the IP and Voice NOC and the equipment vendor will continue in an effort to expedite service restoral."



However, we're still having internet issues.

As always, trace routes are helpful. We've been having intermittent issue with Level 3 routes for the past couple weeks, most issue for us seem to be when going from Level 3 to Global Crossing routes.

Anyone seeing Level3 routing issues? We just observed a massive drop in

adding some filters based on the recent DDOS attacks, I can ping

Remember (and maybe someone can link to the trace route interpretation PDF
from Nanog) that if the packet loss doesn't continue end to end then its
not likely a real issue as the forwarding plane isn't loosing packets. The
loss on a single hop either points to limits on ICMP responses on the
control plane, or congestion on the forwarding plane.

I see no indication of packet loss in this mtr; others have already
explained how to properly read output.  Loss at hop #3 is not indicative
of a universal problem; it would be different if that latency "trickled
down" through all subsequent hops, all the way to the destination.

I do see indication in this mtr of generally high latency (between
London<->Paris), reaching up to 246ms and averaging around 171ms.  I do
not know if that's normal or not, due to my lack of familiarity with
said region/paths.

However, as I've stated repeatedly [like a broken record], a
traceroute/mtr from point A to B is only half the picture -- you need
the same from point B to A, due to asymmetrical routing being
commonplace.

Correct, no packet loss in that mtr but packet loss is occurring from time to time.  The main point of that particular trace was to show the latency which is not normal.  That same trace now is reporting times around 165ms.  The reverse trace which appears to go back along the same path is around 160ms.

Again the problem has been off and on for a while now as others here have said.  I'm just adding my data point and have a ticket with level3 as well.

I'd suggest setting up a cron job that logs the mtr data on two systems
(system A, going from A->B, and system B, going from B->A), so that you
can review it if/when it happens again.

I have a small shell script I wrote, which uses a dorky config file of
sorts, that can do this for you if you want me to provide it.  I use it
on my home FreeBSD system, and my FreeBSD VPS system, checking
connectivity between them (and to some other places as well).

Something like this would be much appreciated. I was thinking of writing
a similar script to mail mtr output on an hourly basis.

I take no responsibility for support or misuse or misunderstanding of
how this works.  Normally anything I release publicly I tend to provide
some degree of support for; this is an exception, i.e. "this works for
me" and was thrown together one day without the usual amount of care or
caution I normally apply when writing code.

I expect people using this to take the time to figure out how it works
(it's not hard); paths/etc. should become fairly obvious once said
examination is done.

People may also need to update to mtr 0.85 to get all the benefits.

Attachments:

mtr.sh = shell script that calls mtr with specific arguments, and reads
a pseudo configuration file from stdin

config = configuration file


cronjob itself:

##
# Periodic mtrs to numerous locations.
#
# EXECUTION: Every 1 minute
#
*/1 * * * *     cd /var/log/captures && cat config | ./mtr.sh


How relevant log files are rotated, how many are kept, etc. -- done
quite simply through FreeBSD newsyslog(8).  That entry:

We say this a lot, but no one's ever explained to me how you're supposed
to break into the apache server at the other end to run the reverse trace.

1/2 :-)
