We are seeing packet loss over Level 3 in Detroit. Level 3 is aware of  
the issue but I do not have a master ticket number.

I saw this splice get completed around at about 17 minutes past midnight
Eastern, but we just started to see a lot of packet loss on Level(3)
again. Does anyone know if there are further issues with Level(3) in
Detroit (or elsewhere), or possible if the night's fiber splice failed
again?

Bill,

This is what I got last night before the cut was repaired. I was  
notified at 1:00AM that the splice had been completed. I still saw  
some packet loss after the repair but I'm guessing I was still on the  
alternate path.

Hope this helps,

-Brian

One of my carriers tells me that last night a "temporary fix" was put in
place but that a permanent repair of the cut fiber is supposed to happen
at midnight tonight (Thursday night). There was some guessing that the
problems earlier today may have been due to trouble with the "temporary
fix". No one seems to have much detail as to what has been happening.

Subject: [outages] peering in LA between XO and Savvis
Message-ID: <49146D79.2060506@sharpone.net>

We are seeing large (20-30%) packet loss in the forward and reverse path 
from XO to Savvis in the Los Angeles peering point. This was happening 
yesterday for about 2 hours, and has picked back up this morning. This 
has made some sites hosted in Savvis unusable for us (like Netsuite).

After working with both vendors, it seems that a DDoS attack, aimed else 
where, which transited XO's peering router in LA was the root cause of 
this issue.

Seems to be cleared up now.

I know a few people who work there.  One of their guys is onsite.  No 
further details at all, I imagine his hands are full (and he's probably 
called in help by now).

I'm not going to speculate what's going on though.

Word is brownout, battery backups didn't kick in and a core router went 
down.  No word on recovery time or anything else at this point.

Hello,

 

We have been getting a lot of players who cannot connect to Final Fantasy XI from Verizon since about 6pm PST yesterday (11/12). I checked the Internet Health Report and found that there are Warning levels between Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon. Anyone have any clues as to what is going on?

So far the only data that I have from them was that they were trying to
make a change with Level3 and "something happened."

 

I have progressed this to my sales team in an effort to get more
information.

Human error.  They were bypassing UPS A for maintenance and there was  
a mislabeled breaker.

Yes, we have had an outage on our DS3 in downtown sanfran since yesterday evening.

We have had no luck dealing with level3, they claim it's part of an OC12 outage, but they have no details, won't callback and no ETR.

>From the little info I have, I suspect it was a grooming of legacy broadwing customers that went bad. They appear to be having troubles putting it back where it was yesterday. If anyone else has any info, I'd love to hear from you.

It doesn't sound like we're talking about the same incident here; one is in
SF, the other "east of the Mississippi."

The parent ticket is #3020259. Other than that, just some very non-specific info. Something about a "missing cross-connect", which they have been stating for over 12 hours now. If it was just missing, dispatch a tech and fix it already.

This could be completely unrelated (especially given that this is west
of Mississippi), but there was a Abovenet and Level 3-confirmed fibre
cut near Houston yesterday afternoon (~1300 PST), which was affecting
eastward traffic (e.g. Houston-->Atlanta).  That fibre was repaired at
approximately 2100 PST.

Quite possibly a different issue, or part of some planned migration. Since I haven't been able to get any details, I have no clue. There is someone else on the Nanog list who was given the same explanation  as us and he is in Wyoming.

There are also reports they are advertising routes they don't have, possibly because of the backbone outage.

The Internet Health Report (http://www.internetpulse.net/) definitely sees some flakiness.

"multiple BGP issues on core routers" after I mentioned I was a 
multihomed customer and their DNS problems wouldn't impact me. I wasn't 
able to coerce any other details out of them.

I gave Sprint a call regarding today's problems and it seems they have
more than one thing going on; there's some kind of DNS issue and
"multiple BGP issues on core routers" after I mentioned I was a
multihomed customer and their DNS problems wouldn't impact me. I wasn't
able to coerce any other details out of them.

Telus PSTN routing in Ontario/Toronto appears to be out since 12:00 EST today.  No further information or confirmation.

If anyone has any pointers to where one can find PSTN monitoring/outage data would be appreciated.

BGP advertiements returned at 02:15 on 11/26/08.  Guess they lost
something big.
