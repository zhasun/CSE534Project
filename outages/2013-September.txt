Getting a similar report here as last week; Verizon and Level3 issue again, just like last week?  Though this time much shorter lived.

Yeah, we noted 15 minutes of high packet loss and high RTTs to hosts inside L3's network. Event went 11:23-11:38 Pacific Daylight Time. Looks fine now. L3 was unaware of a problem.

Yes definitely saw issues on L3 backbone. I am in San Diego, CA and saw my
route to my LA datacenter flap and go to NY and back to LA. After 15
minutes the route reverted to what it originally was.

Message-ID: <7104ae107aab4d35856c46dba151b28d@BN1PR07MB070.namprd07.prod.outlook.com>

I've seen heavy latency on Cox network over the past two days.
My understanding is that it's a peering issue between Cox Communications and Equinix in Ashburn, VA.
This seems to be affecting a lot of customers in the service area.
Anyone else seeing these issues or have anything to add that may help?

"Equinix" is not an ISP. They are a colo provider, and run an Internet Exchange.

If Cox's port to the IX is congested, that would cause issues with some destinations, but not others.

Do you have MTRs, traceroutes, or anything else other than "heavy latency" with zero actual data to help investigate?

Twitter claim to have a web-related issue, not an API - therefore clients

Update: As of 14:19 PDT, this issue has been resolved. Due to a
code-related error, a series of web servers went down from 13:48-14:19 PDT,
making the twitter.com website inaccessible for some users. We apologize
for any inconvenience.

Subject: [outages] Apparent AT&T peering issue with UK 213.171.192.0/19
	AS15418
Message-ID: <20130908182114.9ED5B200DE@smtp.hushmail.com>

Hi,
Hoping someone has the contacts to get this resolved. AT&T apparently
has a peering issue with UK 213.171.192.0/19 AS15418. This has been
going on for over a week, and the site admin and
downforeveryoneorjustme both agree site is up. Called AT&T support
center and got usual clueless person who said "the only reason I can't
get to the site is it is down" and refused to put me in contact with
anyone with 1/2 a clue.

The problem appears to be more than just slow pages and broken links, 

here in Philadelphia, the home page is being displayed in Czech, it never did that before.

Seeing high packet loss from AS13736 headed to AS18101 passing through AS15412.  http://ubs.flagtel.com/lg is showing some noise coming out of LDN004 (which is in our path).

Anyone who might be able to help me isolate this issue from the other side?

Thanks!

It was mainly one availability zone for ELBs, though there is also some
lingering problems with EC2 instances (I think in that same zone).

Amazon has said the ELB thing is resolved, but it's been 2 hours since they
updated the EC2 situation.  Tick tock...

Can confirm we're seeing network issues as well in us-east-1-c. Failed over
instances to other AZ's in the same region they're functioning just fine
currently

Reminder that AWS AZs are lettered differently for different accounts,
e.g. your 1c, might equate to my 1b.

We had a site-to-site VPN tunnel drop, and some (but not all) destinations
become unreachable over our Level3 connection.  Seemed to resolve itself
after about 10 minutes.  I'm based in Chicago.

 

Anyone else see anything similar?  Thanks.

Looks like there's some issues with Level 3 in New York now (and unrelated
to the earlier Chicago outage) - we're showing intermittent packet loss and
strange routing (New York -> Newark, NJ via Dallas) on circuits originating
out of New York.  Circuits originating out of L3's Newark, NJ facility
however seem to be fine.

Yes - Level 3 did report "degraded" access on
car1.NewYork1.Level3.netassociated with a DoS attack on one of the
customers served off that
router.  No master ticket as of a few minutes ago.

From one of our providers 


On September 17th at 12:27 PDT our network monitoring system notified us that our bgp session went down with our upstream provider, Telia, and restored at 12:31 PDT in our SJE PNAP location. Customers homed to the location may have noticed routing reconvergence and sub-optimal routing as traffic re-routed over our other available providers at the PNAP.

We are currently seeing the session up and stable at this time and are investigating the issue with our upstream provider and will update customers if there is any required maintenance.

sure west in Sacramento area earlier as our monitoring is in the Midwest
and I remember seeing telia in the traceroutes

Message-ID: <CAH5HGtB_pQGzy2SPtskdBtseO7LU-JJ=X=_G9yhbCFZ+=kNZyw@mail.gmail.com>

Is anyone else with Bell Canada Ethernet circuits seeing an outage this
morning?

Quite a few of our remote office 100m / 1000m circuits went down at
approximately 08:08 EDT and have remained down.  We've got a ticket opened
with Bell and their website says:


"Network - Highspeed - Intermittent Outage

Customers in the following areas may be experiencing service interruptions:

    Toronto
    Montreal
    Ste-Julie De Vercheres

We apologize for any inconvenience."


Any ideas what the issue is?  Bell remains vague as always.

Thanks,

  - Mike

Bell Canada is having an issue in GTA right now with Ethernet Services. No ETR.

Thanks for confirming JF, all of our OSPF adjacencies just came back up.
We are looking for an RFO from Bell.  It looks like the outage (atleast,
for us) lasted from 08:08 to 11:44 EDT.

Thanks,

  - Mike

Subject: [outages] OT: Weird problem with Firefox & G+
Message-ID: <523F36DD.5020201@mykolab.com>

Pardon the off-topic post, but...

For some bizarre reason, Google+ started giving me an "invisible" page 
after logging in this morning. It starts off fine, but then after 
pulling content from ssl.gstatic.com and *.googleusercontent.com, etc., 
it then goes "invisible".

This is with Firefox 24.0 -- I have, one by one, unloaded and restarted 
Firefox with various plugins disabled (e.g. NoScript, HTTPS Everywhere, 
etc.) and the problem persists.

There *is* content there, it is just "invisible" (e.g. body {
           visibility: hidden;
         })

...and seems to work fine in IE (not my browser of choice).

Just curious if anyone else running Firefox 24.0 has run into this 
problem today on G+, or if Google made some sort of "enhancement" which 
manifests itself this way.

All other Google property pages work fine, just G+ has exhibited this 
behavior today.

Thanks,

- ferg

Subject: [outages] gmail.com 550-5.7.1 refusing mtr(8) output;
	other excessive bounces
Message-ID: <20130922194712.GA10209@Cns.Cns.SU>

This has happened to me several times recently; 
has never happened until a couple of weeks ago.

>From the https://mail.google.com/mail/ web-interface, Cc an alias 
on my server, which expands to, amongst other things, my gmail.com 
email address;  a bounce is immediately received in the thread 
(apparently, gmail doesn't reject the bounces from the very same 
server from which some messages are rejected).  Most likely 
cause:  too many domain names from the mtr(8) output in the message.

Same for sending a similar message directly from my own server, 
directly to my gmail.com address, being in the Cc field:  a 
bounce is received within my own server, no message is received 
at gmail.  The bounce from such an experience is at the end of this message.

I consider this a major outage:  how many other valid semi-automated 
emails addressed to myself have been unfairly rejected by gmail on 
the SMTP level recently?

I also now know why my gmail.com address has been unsubscribed 
from several mailing lists over this summer, citing excessive 
bouncing.  My own mailserver wasn't even involved:

Following up on this...

It appears AdBlock Plus is the culprit here:

https://plus.google.com/116028828272319130998/posts/doopZKh1G3u

So either adding an exception for plus.google.com or simply disabling
for that specific property "fixes" the problem.

FYI,

We have filed a support request with Google as I have had several tickets
from staff about the email delays from Gmail this morning.

Our team is continuing to investigate this issue. We will provide an update

Appropriately enough, that url shows up as a
blank page in my browser.  ^_^;

Seems like the author might have done well
to post the fix to somewhere *other* than the
site having the problem to begin with.  :D

I've not myself seen any, Scott, and yours is the first report.  

<moderator>
But, for the record:

*IT IS NOT PERMISSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO SCRAPE THIS LIST OR IT'S ARCHIVE
FOR EMAIL ADDRESSES FOR COMMERCIAL EMAIL*.

If a list member *solicits* suggestions, recommendations, or quotes, that's
another thing.

The fact that I had to say it concerning these lists should not be considered
evidence for exceptio probat regulum: it's *never* OK to do that.  Anywhere.

Subject: [outages] tumblr custom domains names (72.32.231.8) are down (for
	good?)
Message-ID: <20130929230711.GA10372@Cns.Cns.SU>

Dear outages@,

It would seem like there is no more any web-server at 72.32.231.8.  
This IP address was the IP-address that you had to configure your 
domain name with to have the "custom domain name" feature within 
tumblr.

Currently if I log-in to tumblr, I'm told:  
	"Please update your domain configurations for <..>. Learn more."	 
With the link from "Learn more" following to http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_domains.

It seems like it's been a couple of weeks (or even months) as this has 
been the case, since my tumblr is almost completely gone from Google now.  
However, there was no such message in the dashboard just a couple of 
months ago earlier this year, so, this seems like a somewhat unannounced 
and unexplained downtime.

	Why unexplained and unannounced?

There are no mentions of 72.32.231.8 on that "Learn more" page, 
only 66.6.44.4 is mentioned, and, for completeness sake, no details 
are provided for why anything has had / has to be updated in the first place, 
or when the old IP-address will stop / has stopped serving custom domains.  
And there is not much excuse for such information to be missing here, 
since 66.6.32.0/20 has been allocated for TUMBLR a couple of years ago (2011-04-25), 
yet it seems like it was never explained to the users at large that a change 
was forthcoming.

Were people really supposed to change their settings when everything 
was working and when nowhere was it explained that a downtime would 
be forthcoming should a change not be made and the custom domain 
not re-configured anew?

Well, just a heads-up and a rant, I guess.  (BTW, it seems like the RSS 
imports feature has suffered a similar fate a couple of years prior, too.)

Best regards,
Constantine.

Not completely unannounced.

 From my e-mail archives on the 14th of June (3 months ago):

"Hi there!

We are making improvements to the way we serve our custom domain traffic 
and need you to update your DNS settings before June 21.

For any custom domains using an A Record, please point them to Tumblr's 
new IP: 66.6.44.4

If you do not make this update by June 21, your custom domain will no 
longer redirect to your blog."

With a link to http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_domains.

They also sent 4 e-mails previously regarding the same thing.

Yes, thank you.  I guess they did this time, and I did miss them all.

With the first of these emails dated 2013-05-24, suddenly requiring 
to urgently make the change by June 21.

How nice, giving users a 3 week and 6 day period during the summer 
to make a change to the new IP-address that has been in production 
for probably more than a year or two prior to any such announcement, 
urgent or otherwise.

If the issue described there is what I'm seeing, then it looks like
some part of the 'net in the LA area is very very broken -- and worse,
*has* been broken since roughly Sep 27 21:16:00 PDT (UTC-7).

Reminder: 208.79.90.130 is not physically in Hong Kong.

I haven't spent the time to look at bgplay.routeviews.org yet, but I'm
not sure it'll necessarily have insights into any of this.

I have reached out to ARP Networks to have them check things, but this
is an interesting situation I thought I'd mention as folks more familiar
with BGP than myself could probably assist with.

I can only speculate at this point, but I wonder if AS 9304 may have
announced some kind of preferencing that certain things have picked up
(but never withdrew/changed?).  There are lots of explanations though,
so that's purely hearsay on my part.

Subject: [outages] www.i3d.net is down (another AAAA fiasco)
Message-ID: <20130930051726.GA11642@Cns.Cns.SU>

Hello,

It would seem like i3d.net web-site is down / half-down.

####

P.S. Is anyone keeping any statistics of how many web-sites with AAAA records don't respond on port 80?

Follow-up:

I got lots of off-list responses about this, all of which were very
informative.  Thanks everyone.

Wanted to report that after CoreSite did some maintenance this morning,
things are back in order:

Subject: [outages] Netflix over IPv6
Message-ID: <00a901cebe02$141fe650$3c5fb2f0$@iname.com>

Friday evening, Sunday morning, and Sunday evening, our monitoring system
has seen sporadic HTTPv6 access issues to www.netflix.com.  Starting since
10:36 am Central this morning, I've seen sporadic ICMPv6 failures to
www.netflix.com.

Now www.netflix.com has many AAAA records that are likely different around
the world and I don't have our monitoring system set up to individually
monitor each AAAA record, but wondering if anyone else has seen the same
thing?

Regards,

Frank

================
Current AAAA's, currently pingable:

2406:da00:ff00::b849:f83b
2406:da00:ff00::b849:fcb3

I see a lot of these when sites are transitioning to v6. The host interface
is given a v6 address and the AAAA record is put in, but the server process
hasn't been bound to the v6 address.

Subject: [outages] Level3 ICMP Filtering in Chicago?
Message-ID: <3E9C67DA261AC349B60FF3609F5E211D6F3BB8@USI-2K10EX01-MT.usicorp.usinternet.com>

At about 3:30PM central time today we started seeing ICMP packet loss going into Level3 networks, we believe it is likely some sort of Level3 filtering of some sort.

Two traces below from the same origin to the same destination at the same time, one is ICMP and one is UDP.

It is not just traceroute ICMP packets, we cannot ping our own equipment when it takes a Level3 path. Other UDP/TCP traffic so far seems unaffected.

Is anyone else seeing this? This appears to be a Chicago-area connection.

With direct connectivity to Level3 in Minneapolis (which transits Chicago

Thank you.
It looks like it may just be that Telia hop into Level3 possibly.

It could be the return path that is blocking ICMP echo-reply (i.e.
destination receives ICMP echo, responds with ICMP echo-reply, but goes
out a path/interface that has it filtered).

If you can get on to 204.11.209.66 and capture ICMP (both directions)
you should be able to determine if it's even seeing the echo.

True. We had verified that the ICMP echo is not arriving to the destination, I forgot to mention that already.
Thanks for the pointers to the LG's. I can't seem to find the correct combo on their LG's to replicate this behavior. However if you use http://lg.he.net and choose the origin of Minneapolis the trace goes through this same Telia link in Chicago. 

I will try and reach out more to the parties involved.

Thank you!

FWIW:

I've been grepping through the last 4 years of my mail spool archives to
try and find the name/Email of the individual at TeliaSonera who I
communicated with about issues with Telia in the US the last time I
reported issues.

So far I haven't had any luck, which means it might have been something
older than 4 years ago.  Grumble.  :-(
