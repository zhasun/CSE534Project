We connect into Level(3) in detroit too. Want me to run any traceroutes from my side to help you isolate anything?

We haven't received any complaints, but we have two other carriers so we might just not be seeing the problem.

Looks to me like this might be an issue with Level(3)/ATT peering in Chicago.

I do have one customer complaint of intermittent connectivity which might be related to this issue, but I don't have an IP from them to test yet.

Anyone else seeing any issues in NYC with Lightower/Sidera?  Starting
around 6:05AM (EST) we saw heavy packet loss across their network (from
Sidera legacy) and some of our point to points bounce. The P to P's have
some what stabilized (though we've seen a couple more bounces since then)
the IP side of things have been pretty much unusable (we shut our session
down.)  It also looks like their phone system is having a problem - calls
into them seem to drop after trying to connect to the NOC - which I'm sure
is pretty busy.

Similar experience for me. IP is down and I get a busy signal when I call their NOC.

some what stabilized (though we've seen a couple more bounces since then) 
the IP side of things have been pretty much unusable (we shut our session 
down.)  It also looks like their phone system is having a problem - calls 
into them seem to drop after trying to connect to the NOC - which I'm sure 
is pretty busy.

We use them for L2 transport between Nycm and BSTP. It started taking
errors at approx. 6:05am EST. Thankfully this is just a protect path for us.

Calling their NOC results in busy signals or just dead air.

LightTower/Sidera master ticker for this is LT1323725.

I was able to get through their support line now.

The ETR is 1-2 hours from now.

I contacted their NOC about 45min ago. They have stated they are still
working on resolution. They have reports about some services being
functional, while other still experiencing packet-loss and latency. It does
not sound like they have been able to identify the root cause and are still
troubleshooting.

Here is the number I
? used to get through to their NOC: 888-583-4237, option 1. From there,
just follow the prompts.

Fwiw, my customer circuit from NYC to NJ is still affected.

Subject: [outages] Windstream - NE Ohio / Cleveland
Message-ID: <CEA163A2.8E1C%ben.brown@sunlessinc.com>

Any insight into a Windstream ISP outage in NE Ohio? My EoC services are out but my fiber services are fine.

Looks like outage began around 1/1:30pm EST. Not sure if Hudson or Cleveland NOC.

Was told "a few hours" on outage.

Anyone else seeing any issues in NYC with Lightower/Sidera?  Starting 
around 6:05AM (EST) we saw heavy packet loss across their network (from 
Sidera legacy) and some of our point to points bounce. The P to P's have 
some what stabilized (though we've seen a couple more bounces since then) 
the IP side of things have been pretty much unusable (we shut our session

I was able to get through their support line now.

The ETR is 1-2 hours from now.

Subject: [outages] Lightower/Sidera - NYC

Anyone else seeing any issues in NYC with Lightower/Sidera?  Starting around 6:05AM (EST) we saw heavy packet loss across their network (from Sidera legacy) and some of our point to points bounce. The P to P's have some what stabilized (though we've seen a couple more bounces since then) the IP side of things have been pretty much unusable (we shut our session down.)  It also looks like their phone system is having a problem - calls into them seem to drop after trying to connect to the NOC - which I'm sure is pretty busy.

Confirmed here as well, 7 out of 7 L2 tail circuits not passing traffic after a good hour of instability.

FWIW, I don't recall any recent maintenance announcements from them, so this is a bit troubling (I'd expect this if we saw a big rollout of new code the night previous) since it came out of the blue.  I can also confirm we saw our first outage much earlier than they acknowledged, one circuit lost connectivity at 5:23 a.m.  I can also confirm that we did not see the physical layer go down once on any of our circuits, this seems to be occurring in the core, not the rings that actually service the buildings.

We're legacy ConEd/RCN/Sidera, have no idea if this is happening with the LT network or not.

We got what appears to be a bogus "all restored" email at 2:50 p.m.

As another datapoint, the traditional HV/Datanet/Lightower side of the
network has been stable during this reported outage.

This outage is still on-going. I spoke with an executive at LT earlier
today and the word then was that some downstream customer of the
Sidera/ConEd/RCN legacy network is leaking PVST BPDUs and its wreaking
havoc on their network. I'm not sure how legitimate that is anymore
since its been several hours. Apparently though, since our circuits
are fluctuating up and down every few minutes, it would seem they're
not very close to resolution. We're approaching the 12 hour mark for
certain circuits.

They also don't seem to have any tools to notify/communicate with
their customers about the on-going efforts..and they don't tweet
anything but marketing crap. The management of this incident is
asinine.

Thanks James. I was told of some sort of packet storm causing the outage on their MPLS network. Maybe these BPDUs have spanning tree going haywire. Maybe they had to isolate some PEs from the network and all of us are on those PEs?

Is anyone seeing any issues as a result of identified latency in internet
health report (lot of REDs and yellows in there)

http://www.internetpulse.net/Main.aspx?xAxis=Destination&yAxis=Origin&zAxis=Metric&nAxis=Period

We are seeing timeouts to Google DNS servers 8.8.8.8 around 3 pm MT as well.

We are digging more into this to collect more data as well.

VI NOC is aware of an issue that is affecting both inbound and outbound
calls on our network. Our engineers are actively looking into this and
updates will be provided as more information becomes available. This issue
is affecting calls across all carriers at this time. Please do not respond
to this ticket as it for informational purposes only. We will communicate
with you through this public ticket by providing updates as more
information becomes available.

Our engineers continue to work this issue with our switch vendor. We still
do not have an ETR but have been working diligently to correct the problem.
Please understand that a lack of updates does not mean the issue is not
being investigated. Contrarily, this is our top priority and will continue
to be so until it is resolved. We had updated several times earlier in this
ticket that we thought it was nearly cleared because at the time we felt
that was the case. We will provide any additional information as it becomes
available but we want to reiterate that this issue is actively being worked.

 We have received word that our switch vendor will be performing rolling
restarts across some of our network equipment. They will be assessing the
affect of this on an ongoing basis once this has completed and we will
provide additional updates as information becomes available.

Seeing much weirdness with RR networks, mostly in NYC. Long routing paths, maybe some blackholed traffic, etc.

They have confirmed an issue, not saying much more (yet).

Others seeing same thing?

We have multiple customers on the east coast who are unable to utilize our
NY server for voip. They are getting no audio and there are non responses
to our invites to them.

Some of them have failover routes to our LA server and that seems to be
working fine. Rerouting inbound DIDs through our LA server solves the issue
as well.

It doesn't seem to be a DNS issue as a customer was using IP addresses
because of DNS issues before, he was still having problems.

It seems to affect multiple ISPs, as there were customers from brighthouse,
time warner, AT&T who were having problems.

May be unrelated but we had two 10Gb Lightpath circuits go hard down in NYC @ 10:35AM EST.

Thanks Jason

Could be a coincidence on the endpoints, trouble may be on another network in the path I suppose.

Most of our stuff is on East coast so we're just sitting it out for now rather than rerouting. We don't see a reason to do anything drastic at this point.

For reference, our affected products are also VoIP, not sure if it is relevant.

Started for us around 9:05 AM, may not be related. Would not be surprised if it was something at a lower layer though.

We were seeing Time Warner Cable connected users on the East Coast/Midwest having trouble accessing a few networks of ours. Traceroutes to our networks from Time Warner were all over the place. We?re located in MN.

It seems to have recovered in the past 10 minutes or so though.

They have confirmed an issue, not saying much more (yet).

We saw about 40 min of downtime early this morning (~12:00am - 12:40am CST)
on one of our level3 bgp circuits in the Dallas, TX area and received this
communication from level3:

Level 3 Communications will implement scheduled maintenance to perform
software upgrades as part of a large project on the Level 3 Transport
network, involving several GCRs over several nights. There is a potential
that the same circuit will be impacted across multiple GCRs. This work is
being done in order to provide fixes and features currently unavailable as
well as to maintain current software loads on our network equipment. This
software upgrade is service affecting for Ethernet services terminating to
the devices undergoing this upgrade.

The typical impact ranges from 30 to 230 seconds, with an expected outage
of no more than 5 minutes. If you experience a greater than 5 minute impact
to your services please contact the Technical Service Center at
1-877-4LEVEL3.

Updates

This window of this maintenance has completed successfully.

Google Front End.

It?s also the ?GFE? in the recent NSA slide that?s been bandied about, which is what initially shined some light onto the topic.

To my understanding it?s a google-specific webserver implementation that does ?google magic? to speak to various services on the backend. 

http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ws-gfe/all/all shows a bit about it, but the term is apparently vanishingly hard to google for.

I had the same 500 error for a few minutes, but everything appears to be
back up and running.  I wonder if the Google Trained Monkeys are for hire
for all other IT issues?

Is anyone out there seeing unusual troubles with Verizon? I
am seeing issues that are changing rapidly, so traceroutes
are not too useful.  I get completely different results (all
broken one way or another) on traceroutes 10 minutes apart to
the same IP.  For example 4.4.4.2.

Please don't fill the list with "me too" or "no trouble from X".
Send them to me and, if there's interest, I will summarize for
the outages-discussion later.

Thanks,

One more thing before I get flamed too much.  I can't get 
any BGP info from the network I'm currently on and many 
resources to get that and other normal outages-list 
troubleshooting info are on the mainland are at best 
intermittently available.

It's apparently over.  It seemed to be with alter.net in
Calif.  Maybe where the Hawaii traffic lands in general?
Perhaps that's why I got only one response.  I guess the 
RFO is post to outages-list and poof, the internet heals 
itself.  ;-)  Filed in the <shrug> folder...

I am unable to reach msn.com, due to DNS lookup failures.
http://microsoft.com is responding very slowly within a web browser (it's A

None of the ns[1-5].msft.net nameservers are responding to queries. The

I noticed the same issue with microsoft.com, and can confirm the same

Seeing no problems here in the Denver, CO area. Both microsoft.com and 
msn.com seem to be working just fine from here.

I am unable to reach msn.com, due to DNS lookup failures.
http://microsoft.com is responding very slowly within a web browser (it's A

None of the ns[1-5].msft.net nameservers are responding to queries. The

We have confirmation from SkyWay West that all of their legacy VPOP ADSL 6/1 services down since about 3:30pm Pacific in Vancouver. 

SkyWay West fibre or cable clients do not appear to be affected. 

Skyway Engineering is working on it and has also engaged Telus (wholesale) support.  Root cause is not yet clear.

Subject: [outages] Power loss at CAT Towers, Bangkok Thailand
Message-ID: <CAPdYNsCTJicz-Fktxm0M=TtR16j7Um1ofq0jJJikUhyF-gka-w@mail.gmail.com>

Apparently protesters have cut electricity to CAT (communications authority
of thailand) towers in Bangkok and have taken over the diesel generators.
The building is without power and most international links going out via
CAT would be down.

CAT is the biggest international internet gateway in Thailand.

Cant find news reports about this yet. Above info is based on what thai
people have told me based on reading tweets.

http://internet.nectec.or.th/internetmap/map/internationalmap/inetmap102013_international.jpg

"CAT-IIG" is down for sure. Not sure if any of the others are located in
the same building or not.

Anti-government protestors in Bangkok, Thailand, apparently unaware that their own Internet media, television, and social media use would be negatively affected, shut off electrical power to the main Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) IDC & PoP in the Bangrkak district of Bangkok, and also removed the control system for on-site generators and UPSes serving the facility.  Thousands of Thai Web sites and international Web sites hosted in Thailand are currently unavailable, including major corporate sites such as thaiairways.com; the CAT-run International Internet Gateway (IIG) peering PoP has also been affected, leading to disruption of network peering between participating Thai ISPs and other ISPs operating outside Thailand.  Thai ISPs with private and international peering retain global Internet connectivity, albeit with some latency-induced performance issues resulting from longer topological paths for Internet traffic.

It has been communicated to protest leaders that these actions are counterproductive, given that the protestors themselves are heavily using Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, LINE, and other social media in order to coordinate their activities.  CAT report that they will have new emergency generators deployed within the hour, with police reinforcements to prevent further interruptions of service.

Pro-government political activists have stated that they are mobilizing ~20,000 supporters (it is important to note that numbers of people are routinely exaggerated by all political groups in Thailand) in order to guard the CAT facility against renewed intrusions by protestors.

Power has been restored, most peering seems to be up and after some extended re-convergence, connectivity appears to be largely nominal.  True 3G are still reporting issues related to some PE at Bangkrak, are limiting data subscribers to EDGE until issues are resolved (no ETR, best guess is fairly quickly).

Seems like CAT gateway is back online. Trace to my Singapore box from True
is going thru CAT's gateway and is not lossy.

For a while in between my ISP True (which operates its own gateways) lost
all international connectivity for several users(everyone i asked)
including me. Now that connectivity is restored interwebs is working better
than ever (fingers crossed).

Yes, this was reconvergence, devices coming up in non-optimal states and having to be tweaked, et. al.  Bangrak IDC is now completely online, CAT IIG is completely online.  Only True Move 3G currently experiencing some issues, should be resolved soon.

Protestors have apparently learned their lesson - disrupt the Internet and they lose the ability to coordinate their protests, heh.
