Subject: [outages] Ontario Circuit Outages
Message-ID: <CAC8zsjNiqWPHWg4uA2dXWym1Z8wtj_RKjBJH_WMi719=edCpPA@mail.gmail.com>

Starting around 7:45 AM (-5 GMT) we started receiving alerts that our
primary and backup AT&T managed WAN circuits in St. Catharines,
Ontario were down. Based on reports from the office our PRI is also
down (no SRST). In addition, other businesses in the area are
experiencing the same issues.

The only information I have is from one of our employees that spoke
with a telco worker who said a tree had taken out some fiber.

Six hours later and we have no ETTR, and AT&T seems to be unaware that
there is a local/regional issue.

Has anyone heard anything?

This would definitely be very regional .... Ontario is a pretty big area ;)

We have connections up to St. Catherines with no issues .....

Seeing large amount of packet loss and high latency on a 100mb internet cirucit on integra telecom out of Las Vegas, Nevada.  Have a ticket opened and they said they are aware of an issue within the network in that city.  Looks like they did a software upgrade last night too so that might be the reason for the outage (speculation of course).

Integra has reported that a DOS attack to another customer was the cause of the issue and have taken steps to isolate the effected network.  Service appears to be restored.

I reported it on their internal/external tech list, I was seeing the
outage for about 5-8 min and then it is back working in the last
5-ish.

No clue yet what it was, nobody responded to the report yet.  Not a
hallucination, but transient.

Several times over the last few years I've seen WP outages which turned 
out to be bad config pushed in to production and then quickly reverted.  A 
few were patches to the Mediawiki software, for example.

I guess they don't have a preprod/UAT environment :)  While I can 
understand them being able to simulate the scale, a small UAT environment 
to test config rationality wouldn't go astray.

I hear Wikipedia has a monitoring system.  It involves alerts issued by 
millions of people around the world :)

Cheers,

Rob

I know some of the ops folks and have talked about ops stability on
and off with the deputy director and VP of technology of the Wikimedia
Foundation.  I haven't professionally consulted per se, but have some
info about the ops.

They do have a preprod environment, but there are limitations to it,
and the systems management process is not perfect.  They have been
focused over the last couple of years on stability and disaster
recovery, but with the user growth they see and budget envelope, it's
hard to make huge leaps ahead on stability while growing.

Frankly, most of the large commercial environments I have seen were
run worse, all things considered...

Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.02.1208051118440.16539@admin.chi.technicality.org>

Noticed this morning that my phone wasn't able to get onto AT&T's mobile 
data network; I called ATT and apparently there is an outage in the area 
that is affecting 10 markets.. I am in the fringe of it in the Savage 
area.

The ticket number with ATT is: CM20120804_46235954

Right now it is sporadic for me; one of my phones will usually work, the 
other one will usually not work.. but both work at some points.

No ETR yet; they said the first report was around 9pm yesterday, local 
time.

Voice is still working fine.

That error is returned from your internal (or ISPs) squid cache server
at the quoted rfc 1918 address.

Patrick, thank you for the reply.

I am getting a similar (but not exactly the same) error from my DC, via
Equinix.

Is there a Wikipedia IRC channel?

On IRC, a fiber cut at the Tamba DC is reported.  Workaround is to use the

It just appears to be effecting DIA circuits.  Private circuits appear to be OK.  No idea about other services.

Bell leaked a full table. To add to the fun, it seems that TATA took
the full table and releaked it.

According to NANOG, Bell Canada leaked a full table, and then Tata turned
right around and *re*-leaked that full table.

Hi,

Looks as if AS46618 ( Dery Telecom Inc) is the root cause of this.
AS46618, dual homed to bell and videotron, leaked routes learned from
videotron to bell, which then propagated that to its peers such as Tata.

Based on BGPMon.net data I see that 107,754 prefixes were affected, i.e.
leaked via 577 (bell) 46618 (Dery Telecom Inc). Problem started at
17:27 UTC .

Cheers,
 Andree

I can connect to imap.gmail.com using SSL on port 993. I cannot connect to 
it at all on port 143 - connection times out. SSL connections on port 993 
answers without delay.

Rumor is they got hit by a DDoS yesterday that took some of their servers
off the air for a while.

Symptoms today seem to match that - ns1 and ns2 at least are both
responding, but only occasionally and very slowly when they do.

Two posts on twitter 28 minutes ago confirm what you're seeing.

A friend who uses Peer1 in Toronto says that things are really slow, but
said that there's nothing on Peer1's forum about the issue.

Seems to be back up now, but they are being careful about saying that 
it's fixed.

Those tweets were from my boss and a friend of his, one of those I can

This was brought up previously on the 9th:

https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2012-August/thread.html#4141

Thread name is "IMAP at GMAIL seems down".

...where you even commented in the thread:

https://puck.nether.net/pipermail/outages/2012-August/004147.html

The TCP ports you're testing are non-SSL (plaintext) versions of the
IMAP and POP3 protocols.  Try the SSL versions instead (993 and 995
respectively), just like you did in the previous thread.

Seems fine:

$ telnet imap.gmail.com 993
Trying 209.85.225.109...
Connected to gmail-imap.l.google.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
^]
telnet> close
Connection closed.

$ telnet pop.gmail.com 995
Trying 209.85.225.109...
Connected to gmail-pop.l.google.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
^]
telnet> close
Connection closed.

My advice: stop complaining and instead switch to the SSL versions
already.  Why keep causing yourself grief given the recurring nature of
this problem?

Same here, but I usually use pop3s and imaps

openssl s_client -connect imap.gmail.com:993
and
openssl s_client -connect pop.gmail.com:995

both work.

You are listing out attempts on ports 143 and 110,
but  Gmail POP3 is on port 995, and Gmail IMAP is on port 993.

The right ports seem to connect OK.

Subject: [outages] Level 3 Problems
Message-ID: <CAJk2XQfs0S-a8rHGWDSdF7v_ZWpUsyLUSweECimpdyFT2tbRZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Seeing high latency on Level 3 out of northern New Jersey.  We saw very
slow website loads across many sites and a few page timeouts.  We also see
high latency between our Abovenet circuit and Level 3 where they peer.
Level 3 tech support confirms latency problems and did say a lot of
customers are calling about this. See traceroutes below:

We've seen some packet loss on our customer end points out of NYC over level3 this morning also.  Hosted at 60 Hudson.

Subject: [outages] Level 3 Problems

Seeing high latency on Level 3 out of northern New Jersey.  We saw very slow website loads across many sites and a few page timeouts.  We also see high latency between our Abovenet circuit and Level 3 where they peer. Level 3 tech support confirms latency problems and did say a lot of customers are calling about this. See traceroutes below:

yup, tracker.outages.org is seeing streams of hashtags in regards to

I can confirm this is also causing MMS issues.

My ATT Galaxy S3 is unable to send or receive MMS messages.

Network APN contains an MMS proxy and MMS address of
mmsc.mobile.att.net
and
proxy.mobile.att.net

Both fail to resolve 90% of the time.

Confirmed on every ATT based mobile I have access to.

Not sure if this will come through since we're behind AT&T, but: just got word that this appears to be related to a DoS attack.

I can confirm this is also causing MMS issues.

My ATT Galaxy S3 is unable to send or receive MMS messages.

Network APN contains an MMS proxy and MMS address of
mmsc.mobile.att.net
and
proxy.mobile.att.net

Both fail to resolve 90% of the time.

Confirmed on every ATT based mobile I have access to.

yup, tracker.outages.org is seeing streams of hashtags in regards to
ATT dns issues. Don't have much insight but hopefully someone will
pipe up and tracker.

Not sure if folks saw this,

If it has been resolved, ATT didn?t update their status page, yet.

I can confirm this is also causing MMS issues.

My ATT Galaxy S3 is unable to send or receive MMS messages.

Network APN contains an MMS proxy and MMS address of
mmsc.mobile.att.net
and
proxy.mobile.att.net

Both fail to resolve 90% of the time.

Confirmed on every ATT based mobile I have access to.

yup, tracker.outages.org is seeing streams of hashtags in regards to
ATT dns issues. Don't have much insight but hopefully someone will
pipe up and tracker.

The status page has been the "static" page all day. :)

We saw dmtu.mt.ns.els-gms.att.net come back online about 1530 hrs.
About 2 hours later we saw
dbru.br.ns.els-gms.att.net come alive.

Message-ID: <502D01E9.2080801@cupacoffee.net>

I have reports from our overnight team of access issues, and am trying
to track it down - as our monitoring reported no problems. I believe it
is related to our XO transit link, and was wondering if anyone else
experienced upstream XO issues around the Chicago area last night?

Thanks -- Steve

Has anyone noticed any problems with Sprint circuits this afternoon?

We have four T1s that run from our site in Verona, WI to the Claranet POP in New York.  The alarm lights have been on here in Verona for all four T1s for most of the last couple hours.


(The last mile is a SONET ring provided by our ILEC, TDS Telecom.  I understand it's entirely possible that the problem could be at our ILEC or the cross connect between Sprint and the ILEC, but I wouldn't expect many on this list to see the problem if it is within our ILEC.  ;-)  )

Jeremy,

I picked this up on the list and we had our ILEC and CLEC field resources look into the Calix nodes and hand-off facilities and have no alarms posted at this time. We also have not been contacted by Sprint for any troubleshooting activity either.

Thanks for checking, Kevin (and another TDS Telecom staff member who replied off-list to offer assistance)...

We've seen the circuits in service for almost two hours now (since shortly after I sent the first message).  I know that Claranet opened a ticket with Sprint prior to that time.  I'm making the assumption that Sprint fixed a problem and that it was relatively isolated in scope, judging by the lack of "me too" messages on the list.

If I had any suspicion that the problem was at TDS, I definitely would have called in a ticket.  Your folks are good at checking on things for me, even though these particular circuits technically belong to Sprint.  The lack of unhappy lights on the Calix node pointed me away from suspecting that TDS owned the problem.   ;-)

Cablevision users are reporting issues getting to sites as well, and 
Cablevision confirmed it is some routing issue (so says a user).

Cablevision is having an outage in CT/NY right now -- intermittent
connections, strange routing, etc. so I'm sure what you're seeing is
related to that. Here's what we saw before (coming from Sidera in NYC going
to a site in Stamford, CT - though we're having this with pretty much all
sites in CT & NY):

Traceroutes look better now - but reachability doesn't.

Is anyone experiencing one-way audio on Verizon Business (SIP) service?

We have multiple customers experiencing this.  The SDP looks fine and we see two-way audio flowing, but one side can't hear anything.  We are confident it is not an issue local to us, but it would be great to get confirmation that it is a larger outage.

If we re-route to Level 3 the issue does not happen.

I learned late yesterday about some dsl subscribers in the
Verizon-serviced area code 760 in California, 978 in Merrimack Valley,
Massachusetts, and surrounding areas experiencing connectivity issues.

Not sure if this relates to your issue.

=================================================================

If our customers having problems were on DSL I'd never have posted.  8-)   They would be considered "off-net".  We have very few off-net customers since we can't control QoS for those customers.

 Relaying from another group - they had a master ticket open on this one-way audio issue and were already working on it when I asked about it (a little after 10) I got the impression it was a fairly isolated issue.

Sorry for the delay in replying, I did want to confirm: it's not you, it's us :)

We have multiple customers experiencing this.  The SDP looks fine and we see two-way audio flowing, but one side can't hear anything.  We are confident it is not an issue local to us, but it would be great to get confirmation that it is a larger outage.

If we re-route to Level 3 the issue does not happen.

I pulled the master ticket and it says incident resolved.  Please call into support if you are still experiencing problems.

Can I get the master ticket #?  We would like to route the calls back to VZ when the outage is resolved.

 Relaying from another group - they had a master ticket open on this one-way audio issue and were already working on it when I asked about it (a little after 10) I got the impression it was a fairly isolated issue.

Sorry for the delay in replying, I did want to confirm: it's not you, it's us :)

Seeing fiber get shot is normally something seen in the countryside
during hunting season.  Generally a few cases a year of that
happening.  Rare for the city.

Time Warner seems to be having an issue affecting all accounts in the 
North East, as per their support line.

 From 14:45 - 15:00 EST we saw packet loss and high latency on our fiber 
circuit to them. Additionally, phone service provided over coax 
experienced a total outage.

As of 15:00 the packet loss has ceased and dial tone is back, however, 
latency is very high (100ms - 800ms) to locations outside the TWC network.

FYI.

The status page on linode indicates it's a power issue.

Power has been restored and they're working to bring all associated nodes back online.

3:52pm (EDT): NAC has informed us of a power issue affecting at least
some portion of the datacenter. As soon as power is restored we are
poised to execute our recovery procedures to all affected systems.

This is the incident report from NAC:
Subsequent to the utility power failure at our Cedar Knolls facility
the generator that powers systems A and D did not start automatically.
Manual intervention was required to get generator power running.
Unfortunately before the generator was manually engaged customers on
these systems experienced a complete power loss. We are still
investigating why the generator did not engage automatically.Utility
power has been restored, and transfer back to utility was successful.

Is it common practice to have an array of batteries in between the colo and the generators to give you time to start the generators?

It is common to have not only strings of batteries but an ATS, or automatic transfer switch. In this case, it sounds like the fault was on the ATS side of the plant based on the IR below.

Is it common practice to have an array of batteries in between the colo and the generators to give you time to start the generators?

This is the incident report from NAC:
Subsequent to the utility power failure at our Cedar Knolls facility the generator that powers systems A and D did not start automatically.
Manual intervention was required to get generator power running.
Unfortunately before the generator was manually engaged customers on these systems experienced a complete power loss. We are still investigating why the generator did not engage automatically.Utility power has been restored, and transfer back to utility was successful.

Sounds like to me they possibly switched over to battery successfully, however battery power was not sufficient while they got the generator functioning.  Most large datacenters I have experience with have 30-45 minutes of battery.  In an instance where you have generator issues, sometimes it could take a half an hour or more to get something functioning.  

We had an issue in our small datacenter about 2 years ago where the ATS didn't properly detect the power failure (long story, bad electrician).  As it occurred at about 2am (we are not 24/7 in building) it took me nearly 30 minutes to get to the office thanks to snow.  I barely beat the battery as everything was under  10% remaining.

I have had customers in the same situation where their generator didn't start properly for one reason or another.  Even with staff in house, it still has taken 20-25 minutes to get generators started.  

This to me stresses the importance of planned generator testing.  Testing the generator, battery systems and ATS systems is very critical.  This is why about once a month, I flip the mains to the datacenter (planned of course) to make sure everything is still fully functional.  A planned 30 second test alerts us of any possible physical issues.  Also by planning these we find out about possible issues sooner rather than later.  If an ATS fails during a test, we ride on battery a few minutes and I go back to utility with no harm done.

The fault was related to an automatically operated circuit breaker on one of several generators. It would not close automatically, and had to be persuaded, which took some time. Further details will be made available to customers as soon as the post-event investigation is complete.

Yes, of course, but usually with big facilities that runtime is in
minutes, not hours. Or seconds for the flywheel types. And when big
breakers or big engines decide to act up they do so quite stubbornly.
The larger the system the longer it takes to fix a fault even if you
know exactly what's wrong.

In any case, even if there is hours and hours of battery runtime, what
does it matter if the air handlers are off?

Didn't something similar with NAC happen back in April?

I'm noticing a common trend here.
