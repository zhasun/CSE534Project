DreamHost appears to be down.  www.dreamhost.com and associated domains.  Mail affected as well.

Can't ping them either.

Unfortunately my e-mail is through them so I won't be able to see any responses to this.  Here's my traceroute:

The problem appears to be localized to portions of their infrastructure.
While I cannot reach Dreamhost.com, all of my sites hosted on several
different Dreamhost servers are loading right now and I am getting
responses from their DNS servers.

I live in Sarasota and got an e-mail press release from the Sheriff's
Office this morning about this (linked below).  I haven't seen any
additional information come out yet.

I live in Sarasota too; no more details as of yet.  In other news that
press release is a little concerning:

"It is important to note, cell phones do not automatically provide a
location, so be aware of where you are calling from when dialing
9-1-1."

Is Sarasota County not E911 phase 2 compliant?

My understanding is that the E911 location lock can take some time and is not always super accurate. Something I read in a Slashdot post years ago, though.

>From Wikipedia:
E911 Phase 2
95% of a network operator's in-service phones must be E911 compliant ("location capable") by December 31, 2005. (Several carriers missed this deadline, and were fined by the FCC.[4])
Wireless network operators must provide the latitude and longitude of callers within 300 meters, within six minutes of a request by a PSAP.[5] Accuracy rates must meet FCC standards on average within any given participating PSAP service area by September 11, 2012 (deferred from September 11, 2008).[6]

I live in Sarasota too; no more details as of yet.  In other news that press release is a little concerning:

"It is important to note, cell phones do not automatically provide a location, so be aware of where you are calling from when dialing 9-1-1."

Is Sarasota County not E911 phase 2 compliant?

No complaints from customers.  Call levels on numbers in those areas are

FYI, I got an e-mail from the Sarasota Sheriff's Office at 9:09pm
(eastern) that phone service has been restored.  There is no specific
mention of 911 in that note, but I assume that's what they're
referring to since that was the only outage that they announced
earlier.  No cause or details, unfortunately.

Just like to make community aware that we have a planned maintenance for
tonight (3/8/2012) starting 8pm PST.

Window Start: 03/08/2012 - 8:00pm PST
Window End: 03/08/2012 - 9:00pm PST

We will be performing software maintenance on wiki.outages.org starting
at 8:00pm tonight PST. However This re-route of
traffic is being done a day prior to the change to make sure we have
routing (ingress/egress) stability maintained during this change window.
We plan to re-route the traffic back to LEVEL3 facing core after the
upgrade window.

We are expecting to re-route about 350mbps of traffic and wanted to give
you a heads up.

Our network engineering team will be on site performing this task on
friday.


Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Looks like AWS has taken a hit in East (Virginia).  EC2 outages is what we're seeing here, no word yet on other services.

Amazon has yet to confirm this, but Twitter is all? atwitter, about it.

I'm seeing what looks like communications failures amongst EC2 instances in us1east. The instances themselves do not appear affected (no lost instances or reboots) just IP traffic. 

It also seems to have settled down now substantially.

Indeed.  Looks to have stabilized now; I was seeing trace routes die a couple hops out from my east instances.

What was interesting is that Twitter reacted before Amazon's status page did.  Makes me wonder if that's a monitoring failure on Amazon's part, or a more cynical "Let's not tell them we're down and see if they notice" position.

Back to bed I go.

Around a week ago, I had (non-fatal) connectivity issues for hours in
the US-WEST-1 region across multiple unrelated instances that I
actually reported to them, and it still never made it to their status
page. Similar but more fatal problems then reoccurred the next day,
and those finally made it to their status page after about a 30 minute
delay.

I really wish they would release some sort of postmortem about these
sort of things, rather than just the generic "connectivity issues" we
get on their status page. I could certainly speculate about what sort
of issues they wouldn't want to disclose (e.g., successful attacks on
AWS infrastructure), but speculation often leads to the wrong answer
when you don't have proper information.

There are other sites going through Level3 that do work (I picked from a

Subject: [outages] Anyone else seeing IPv6 issues going through Level3?

I monitor over 30 IPv6 hosts, and starting around 1:54 am (Central) I
couldn't access about a third of them.  Here's the list of sites that I
currently can't access:

ipv6_akamai_com_29  (2001:418:2401:9::8367:8929)
ipv6_akamai_com_40  (2001:418:2401:9::8367:8940_
ipv6_cnn_com 
ipv6_google_com 
ipv6_sprint_com

www_facebook_com_b (2620:0:1c18:0:face:b00c:0:2)

Thanks, Teun.  

Someone else pointed to me offlist that this could be just our prefix, 2607:fe28::/32.  I've already contacted our upstream provider who buys the transit from Level3.

Our upstream provider opened up a ticket with Level3 late this afternoon.
Hopefully it will be resolved, soon.  

Our upstream provider has three dual-stacked transit providers and they shut
down the Level3 IPv6 peering, but then we lost access to another third or so
of the sites.  For example, ipv6.t-mobile.com is only visible to us from
Level3, same with www.globalcrossing.com.  ipv6.cablelabs.com is with HE and
Level3 and we should be able to get HE via Sprint, but we lost visibility
anyways.

Service was restored to me at 7:15 pm.  I don't have an RFO -- I can only
guess there was some routing table issue for our netblock in Level3's
infrastructure.

I get all the way through.

Try using Level3's LookingGlass (http://lg.level3.net/) and see if there is
anything unique about your prefix.  You can also use their ping gateway,
choose Atlanta, and see if you can ping yourself.

Subject: [outages] Amazon EC2
Message-ID: <CB9629B7.7A69C%Michael.Self@PhoneFusion.com>

We are seeing issues with our Amazon EC2 instances that appear to be networking related.  Amazon has not updated their status dashboard (like they EVER do in a timely fashion, right?).

Anybody else seeing packet loss or other EC2 issues in general that would lead on to the conclusion that Amazon is having AWS problems?

Thank you,
Mike.

Yes, we are seeing increased latency and dropped packets to our EC2
instance on the east coast.  

 

Although this site (http://cloudfail.net/) is reporting connection
timeouts problems have been resolved, but I'm still seeing higher than
normal latency.

NTT is having some router problems in multiple locations. Could be related.

I saw a blip between one of their US-EAST DCs and their NTT transit.
Level 3 and GBLX traffic to that DC was not affected, as far as I can
tell.

I do not currently see a packet loss issue.

Yup, we're also seeing connectivity problems in us-east.

The problems we're seeing are outbound path related - (us-east to IAD), 
and started right at 17:30 UTC.
