We lost our Internap connection at 23:58 UTC in Chicago (at Equinix).
Internap reported a hardware failure that was fixed within about 10
minutes. 

We also noticed strangeness with other providers in other locations at
the same time - AT&T, in particular - that is probably attributable to
reconvergence.

My source address is within northern California Comcast IP space.  I
don't use IPv6 at all.

AAAA records.

We did see it out for about 10 minutes, but it's back now. That particular route was going through HE.net and it looked like a routing loop within their own network at 199.43.0.1 and 199.43.0.6

I use arin.net as an IPv6 monitoring point from my AS and the monitor
was reporting unreachable starting around 10:25 and clearing at 10:45
Pacific time.

I am also experiencing some issues with GoDaddy email hosting.
 
I use POP3s and have not received a number of emails that I know have been
sent to me in the past 30 - 45 minutes.

Another popular site which is affected by this is
DSLReports/BroadbandReports.

I'm quite surprised so many people rely entirely on one provider for
primary, secondary, and tertiary DNS.

$ dig @a.gtld-servers.net ns dslreports.com

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;dslreports.com.                        IN      NS

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
dslreports.com.         172800  IN      NS      ns1.easydns.com.
dslreports.com.         172800  IN      NS      ns2.easydns.com.
dslreports.com.         172800  IN      NS      remote1.easydns.com.
dslreports.com.         172800  IN      NS      remote2.easydns.com.
dslreports.com.         172800  IN      NS      ns6.easydns.net.

Doesn't look like very much redundancy to me.  Grouped by netblock:

ns1.easydns.com has address 64.68.192.10
remote1.easydns.com has address 64.68.192.10

ns2.easydns.com has address 72.52.2.1
remote2.easydns.com has address 72.52.2.1
ns6.easydns.net has address 72.52.2.1

I have been seeing unsolicited DNS replies from them since Jan 8th about 16:36 EST.  I also started seeing them from:

at about the same time, so I suspect they are/were also getting slammed.

As reported on NANOG, AWS had issues with their Virtual Private Cloud on the
east coast.  From Amazon's dashboard:

3:56 PM PST We are investigating increased packet loss impacting VPN
connections in the US-EAST-1 region.
5:20 PM PST Between 2:15pm - 4:09PST, some customers experienced elevated
packet loss via VPN and Direct Connect to some VPC instances in the Northern
Virginia (US-EAST-1) region. The service is now operating normally.

According to the NOC;  "We have a ten gig circuit down between Atlanta
and Florida, we have shaved traffic as it's causing several issues"

I can confirm that we only see the Atlanta Region network on our ports
to them from Atlanta and we have no Ingress traffic at all coming in to
the ports.

So "shaved" seems to mean let's stop sending and announcing routes.

Anyone aware of issues with NTT.com?  I'm not able to reach dreamhost.com located in southern California, which is a problem as they are our e-mail host.  However, I can reach them from my home computer (different ISP) and a couple other ISPs.  But some of my employees located across the United States working from home are not able to reach dreamhost.com either and thus no e-mail.  A traceroute appears to show it dying at ntt.com:

The issue is probably at dreamhost's edge with NTT if I had to guess though.

I have the same issue reaching dreamhost over NTT.

The issue is probably at dreamhost's edge with NTT if I had to guess though.

When I traceroute from an IP on NTT's network I have no issues, but what's
interesting is that the second hop is Cogent, so perhaps that's not a real
test.

Subject: [outages] Problems at NTT?

Anyone aware of issues with NTT.com?  I'm not able to reach dreamhost.com
located in southern California, which is a problem as they are our e-mail
host.  However, I can reach them from my home computer (different ISP) and a
couple other ISPs.  But some of my employees located across the United
States working from home are not able to reach dreamhost.com either and thus
no e-mail.  A traceroute appears to show it dying at ntt.com:

It seems like all traffic to dreamhost has shifted from NTT to Cogent.

FYI --

We had a hit to the Internet traffic flowing through one of our
datacenters earlier on a Level 3 circuit and they confirmed that there
was an outage in their Chicago location.  Our hit was at about 2:04 -
2:07PM EST.  I spoke w/ a helpdesk guy about 15 minutes ago and was
told that traffic was re-routed around the affected device.  No
further issues from my end though.

Saw some packet loss alarms to customers going over Level3 in Dallas Tx 
around same time.  Seems to have cleared here also.

We've received two calls complaining about access to www.ebay.com.  Further
checking shows that none of our DNS servers can resolve either www.ebay.com

difference, and our upstream provider's DNS servers are acting the same way.

Digging against 8.8.8.8 works fine, but against the 4 NS servers listed for
ebay, they don't, probably because their DNS server is all ebaydns.com.

Update -- there's a routing loop between our upstream provider and Sprint.
Hence the lack of DNS resolution. =)

Subject: [outages] DNS resolution of ebay.com

We've received two calls complaining about access to www.ebay.com.  Further
checking shows that none of our DNS servers can resolve either www.ebay.com
or ebay.com.  DIG returns a "timed out".  Flushing our caches made no
difference, and our upstream provider's DNS servers are acting the same way.

Digging against 8.8.8.8 works fine, but against the 4 NS servers listed for
ebay, they don't, probably because their DNS server is all ebaydns.com.

I've got 100% lost packets involving multiple locations throughout the US and see odd traceroute behavior.

Thanks!

We don't use Verizon MPLS at my workplace (instead just direct IP
peering, e.g. BGP and physical connectivity), but we aren't seeing any
anomalies.

We also use Verizon IPTF, which I believe goes across their MPLS-based
backbone, and we're not seeing any anomalies from any of Verizon's SBCs
across the US (Georgia, New York, and California).

Do you have an MPLS-capable traceroute available on your routers which
you can use to narrow down which portions in their network are
responsible (usually will show MPLS tags)?

Brad et al,

A little birdie within Verizon tells me that there was, quote, "a major,
*MAJOR* outage that has occurred".  I didn't get any more details
(because we saw no impact relating to my workplace), but our Account Rep
was surprised to know we knew of "an MPLS issue".  :-)

We saw the outage as well, however we didn't have 100% packet loss. We only
had loss to internet destinations (seems as though 0/0 was blackholed). The
prefixes in PIP that were destined to non-internet stuff stayed up. Anyone
else see this kind of behavior??

Rumor is that they somehow injected a 0/0 into an assload of VRFs,
somewhere on the east coast.

Sounds like a resume generating event...

I tested from servers in two different locations and only see packet loss on
the second-last hop, nothing on the last hop.  This suggests that there may
be some kind ICMP rate-limiting on earlier intermediate hops, but I've seen
no indication of packet loss to the end-point, which is the most important
thing.

Still affecting some customers, including us.  Fiberlight was in Equinix 
space in a building that was condemned and was forced to move fiber 
terminations from what I can gather.  Obviously it is/was not going well.

We are still not restored, I am sure there are others.  And they have a 
POP in our building in Delray, I am assuming it is not restored as 
well.  Piss poor.

The TV Channel or the website? Both are working for me :)

How about some more information, rather than just trying to be the first to
announce it. What's your IP (or you upstream, or whatever you're happy to
share). What errors do you get? Does traceroute give you anything useful to
work from?

Sounds a bit like the out-of-hours escalation I got from our service desk this
morning - "Customer X is reporting that their Internet is down".

Solving site load issues with database replication is a lot like
solving your own personal problems with heroin -- at first, it sorta
works, but after a while things just get out of hand.

The default starting port in UNIX traceroute is 33434. This comes from
32768 (2^15, or the max value of a signed 16-bit integer) + 666.

Subject: [outages] Reachability issues in NA
Message-ID: <CAOF0KO8-TE4H04LLDAwOiv3HAc8+YSNfC==_x=uLmUXROSURPA@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone seeeing general reachability issues in  North America particularly
East Coast or things going through New York or Philadelphia?

I looked at the internet traffic report and see a lot of 100% packet loss
but not sure how much I should read into that.

We went out of band on a MiFi and still had issues getting around.

Seems to have cleared up for at least us.

Message-ID: <FEB36795CFD79344B2DE952392CE502302879CAA@MIL-MBX-02.Neopost.NA>

(Let me know if this is not something you guys want to hear about. They cover a lot of Missouri so I'm submitting this)

Mediacom, an ISP that covers a wide area of Missouri (and the exclusive provider in some areas) has a fiber cut and their customers have lost internet connectivity.

Per their Twitter feed:
"There was a transport fiber damaged" (31min ago)
"There is currently a very large outage due to a damaged fiber line. Our technicians are working as quickly as they can."
