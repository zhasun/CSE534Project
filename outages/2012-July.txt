Subject: [outages] Motorola encoders also affected by leap second
Message-ID: <000001cd5748$2f1a7fa0$8d4f7ee0$@iname.com>

Some of the Motorola encoders (SE-4xxx/5xxx/6xxx, NE-4xxx) that feed our IP
TV system had a few channels go black at the time of the leap second.  Moto
anticipated this event as they had a longish write-up that mentioned
testing.  Their recommendations were to either ignore it and have a 50%
change of enduring a 20-second outage or stop ntp before the leap event and
then start it again thereafter.  It appears that those who manage the
encoders chose the first option, but not all encoders made it through as
Moto predicted.  Those that stayed black needed to rebooted and some had to
be re-programmed.

Note that our Dell server saw a marked increase in the CPU used by the dsm_om_connsvcd service which I believe has a java component.

I don't know what operating system you're running there, but I'm going
to assume some Linux distribution.

You also didn't provide the timezones those systems are in, so your
logging messages aren't as useful (to me) as they could be.  I'm going
to guess UTC+1 (keep reading for how I determined that :-) ):

I'll explain a bit more about this, but since I use FreeBSD the system
and behaviour may be a bit different.  I imagine the ntpd and kernel
time bits are similar/identical though.

This year's leap second occurred on 06/30 at 23:59:60 UTC or
thereabouts.  That means it works like so:

2012/06/30 23:59:59 UTC
2012/06/30 23:59:60 UTC -- leap second occurs here
2012/07/01 00:00:00 UTC

My below logs are taken from two FreeBSD systems (I can check more if
need be), which are UTC-7 (PDT) timezone:

Jun 28 06:39:55 sys1 ntpd[1560]: kernel time sync status change 6001
Jun 29 17:24:31 sys1 ntpd[1560]: kernel time sync status change 2011
Jun 30 17:04:57 sys1 ntpd[1560]: kernel time sync status change 2001

Jun 29 06:33:38 sys2 ntpd[77470]: kernel time sync status change 2001
Jun 29 17:14:34 sys2 ntpd[77470]: kernel time sync status change 2011
Jun 30 05:59:24 sys2 ntpd[77470]: kernel time sync status change 6011
Jun 30 06:07:58 sys2 ntpd[77470]: kernel time sync status change 2011
Jun 30 17:01:31 sys2 ntpd[77470]: kernel time sync status change 2001

(Note: bit 14 (0x4000) defines PLL or FLL operation mode (1=FLL).  On
FreeBSD this tends to toggle quite often, and nobody (TMK) has ever
figured out why.  My point is to ignore bit 14 in the above output)

For sys1, 06/29 17:24:31 + 7 hours = 06/30 00:24:31 UTC
For sys2, 06/29 17:14:34 + 7 hours = 06/30 00:14:34 UTC

Based on this we can see that ntpd almost certainly noticed the upcoming
leap second 24 hours in advance.  I imagine that value (24 hours, or
86400 seconds) is not chance -- Wikipedia hints at things like "mean
solar days" and so on.  So I imagine ntpd prepares in advance for this
ordeal.

Remember: ntpd does not blindly set the clock in large increments (like
ntpdate does) -- it works directly with the kernel to adjust the clock
in very, very small amounts (milliseconds or microseconds, I forget
which) so that there is minimal impact to underlying applications.
(I'll never forget people telling me back in the 90s to simply make a
cronjob that calls ntpdate... *shakes head)

Now for the status bits:

On FreeBSD the bits are described in /usr/include/sys/timex.h and are
part of the kernel, not ntpd itself:

#define STA_PLL         0x0001  /* enable PLL updates (rw) */
#define STA_INS         0x0010  /* insert leap (rw) */

These status bits are also used in "time sync error xxxx" messages (yes
I'm looking at the ntpd source).

On FreeBSD, the only condition where "kernel time sync error" can happen
is when ntp_adjtime(2) (a syscall) returns TIME_ERROR.  TIME_ERROR is
defined as "clock not synchronised".  Looking at the FreeBSD kernel
code, ntp_is_time_error() is what causes TIME_ERROR to be returned by
ntp_adjtime(2).  There are only 4 conditions where this can occur:

1. Hardware or software clock error
2. PPS signal lost when time or freq. sync is requested
3. PPS jitter when time sync requested
4. PPS wander exceeded or calibration error when freq. sync requested

So back to your logs:

Jun 30 01:07:05 -- enable STA_INS
Jun 30 14:42:25 -- time sync error (current status: PLL update + STA_INS)
Jun 30 18:10:21 -- time sync error (current status: PLL update + STA_INS)
Jul  1 01:08:22 -- disable STA_INS

Based on this I would say your system is is UTC+1, given how ntpd
behaves (described above).

As for your time sync errors -- not too sure about those.  I'm looking
at kernel mailing lists and general Usenet posts from folks familiar
with the NTP innards, but it's hard for me to determine if the errors
you saw were the result of STA_INS being enabled or if they were the
cause of something like, say, an upstream NTP server returning a time
that results in a very large offset.  It could also be that one or more
of the NTP servers upstream from you, which were active ("*" in ntpq -c
peers) went offline?  Not sure.  It could also be a kernel or ntpd bug.
Just from looking at Google for the phrase "PLL update" there are all
sorts of bugs/issues that have been discussed + fixed, and one of them
pertains to PLL updates needing to be done slightly differently for
situations where network connectivity to a server becomes erratic.

In general I wouldn't worry about it.  It's obvious that by 07/01 at
01:08 UTC+1 your system was back to normal.  :-)

Same for me - giving "connection refused", so someone managed to bind
the service to v4 only...  (or it's a v6-to-v4 proxy that's down).

Be sure to note the long delay (45 sec) too.  Use of -4 (force IPv4)
also has no bearing, just as a data point.

Looks like some issues with Level3 public facing resolvers.
209.244.0.3 seems to be down.
209.244.0.4 seems to be intermittent.

Just forwarding off from another list.

All the utility outage maps out that way are still showing *numerous*
outages. I suspect there will be people running on generator out there
at least into late this week.

 

I noticed on Saturday that we lost sync with tick.usno.navy.mil (and
also tock...) for some 19(ish) hours starting late Friday night.

Hi,

We're seeing OpenDNS reply with incorrect results on one of our domain
names.  Google's DNS responds fine as do others.  It's only with one
of our machine names when asking OpenDNS name servers for the IP.  No
other machines in that domain have issues.  We've confirmed that DNS
services are configured right.

Both OpenDNS servers at 208.67.220.220 and 208.67.220.222 are
resolving the wrong IP with nslookup.

Anyone seeing any other issues with DNS or OpenDNS tonight?

Thanks!

Neil

Perhaps if you mention the hostname and IP your having issues with, we 
could provide further input.

I do not mind-read, so I have no idea which domain or hostname your 
reference.

I don't think the OP is really concerned with the domain/ip he has
already checked into and verified to be incorrect. But interested if
others are seeing the same thing for their domain or whether it is just
his.

OpenDNS has been working fine for me on my domain name resolutions.  Perhaps check their cache checker and have them do a refresh?

We have a number of circuits down.  I have received a report of "a major fiber cut in northern NJ impacting a large area."  

Does anyone have any information as to if this is actually a fiber cut or just ILEC stupidity (as usual)?

Eric,

1. Circuits with which carrier?

2. Circuits used for data or voice?

3. When did the circuits go down (include timezone)?

4. What does "down" mean (e.g. LOS, LOF, logically down, or is
everything actually up just that data isn't flowing)?

5. Are you able to determine if your issue is truly as wide as an ILEC
or if it's specific to just your CLEC?  (They may be the same, but
naturally it depends)

It could still be a fiber cut even if it's CLEC-specific, but this gets
into a discussion about who owns what, how much of it they own, and what
ties in to what.  You know how this goes...

It is hard to say because we always have data circuits and POTS down from multiple carriers at multiple locations.   Where "down" means "loss of dialtone" or "on-site router not reachable".

I wondered about a fiber cut this time because we have multiple locations in NJ with ALL POTS down and Verizon has a Mater Ticket.

	It is hard to say because we always have data circuits and POTS down from multiple carriers at multiple locations.   Where "down" means "loss of dialtone" or "on-site router not reachable".
	
	I wondered about a fiber cut this time because we have multiple locations in NJ with ALL POTS down and Verizon has a Mater Ticket.

	Eric,
	
	1. Circuits with which carrier?
	
	2. Circuits used for data or voice?
	
	3. When did the circuits go down (include timezone)?
	
	4. What does "down" mean (e.g. LOS, LOF, logically down, or is everything actually up just that data isn't flowing)?
	
	5. Are you able to determine if your issue is truly as wide as an ILEC or if it's specific to just your CLEC?  (They may be the same, but naturally it depends)
	
	It could still be a fiber cut even if it's CLEC-specific, but this gets into a discussion about who owns what, how much of it they own, and what ties in to what.  You know how this goes...

As per subject, the DNS Changer Working Group (DCWG) site for the US is down atm. Also another very probably related issue; Foxnews, CNN, and MSNBC have all apparantly run stories in the last few hours about how the internet end is nigh, everyone is infected, and if you have any questions call your isp.  (Hype levels varied per channel, I'm told as well).

I noticed a similar thing last night after my mother called me after
hearing about it on the local news. It timed out on me a few times
before I could get the site to load.

It looks like this just cleared up after watching routes switch around in Comcast's network.

Vinny,

Thanks -- got the screenshot.  Short version is:

69.39.160.194 --> 74.95.232.29

 8. 68.85.245.150      0.0%  1735   45.0  48.9  44.9 175.1  16.2 (Bearcreek)
 9. 68.85.245.154     76.5%  1735   55.5  57.9  50.3 164.3  14.3 (Royalton)
10. 68.85.245.206     77.0%  1735   55.0  59.0  51.5 170.2  16.3 (Bisbee)

...and similar loss all the way to destination...


74.95.232.29 --> 69.39.160.194

 5. 68.85.245.205      0.0% (Royalton)
 6. 68.85.245.153      0.0% (Bearcreek) 
 7. 68.84.94.137       0.0% (Dallas)
 8. * * *            100.0%
 9. 173.167.56.182     0.0% (per ARIN, Comcast Business netblock)
10. * * *            100.0%
11. * * *            100.0%

...where the destination is eventually reachable but there is very high
packet loss throughout all subsequent hops...

Agreed: to me this looks like something happened within the Comcast
network within Texas.  It may have been as simple as circuit issues or
a router rebooting or experiencing issues "briefly".

If this is business-class service, you might be able to reach out to
whoever your sales/support rep is and try to get an answer.
Alternately, the only choices I see are to ask on either the Comcast HSI
(publicly viewable) or Comcast Direct (customer-to-Comcast only) forums
over on DSLR/BBR, respectively:

http://www.dslreports.com/forum/comcast
https://secure.dslreports.com/forum/comcastdirect

Ren Provo might have some ideas or insights, if she's lurking... :-)

It now goes direct from Greenspoint to Baytown. I was watching the routes change on Comcast's network. We aren't seeing an issue anymore. I was just wondering if anyone knew the cause. I'm suspecting maybe a large pipe was lost between Greenspoint and Baystown and the new path couldn't support the traffic load, but I'm just speculating. I wish I had an mtr from Comcast back to us, but alas I'm working with end users second hand on Windows when I asked for the information.

It now goes direct from Greenspoint to Baytown. I was watching the routes change on Comcast's network. We aren't seeing an issue anymore. I was just wondering if anyone knew the cause. I'm suspecting maybe a large pipe was lost between Greenspoint and Baystown and the new path couldn't support the traffic load, but I'm just speculating. I wish I had an mtr from Comcast back to us, but alas I'm working with end users second hand on Windows when I asked for the information.

This is a known issue that is being actively worked in the area. From
the trouble ticket, it looks like a big fiber cut. I have no other
details at the moment.

I've been talking to someone involved with the DCWG and they appear to have fixed the traffic handling issues. It accesses nice and fast for me now.

I noticed a similar thing last night after my mother called me after
hearing about it on the local news. It timed out on me a few times
before I could get the site to load.

Message-ID: <CAMaTcxWQ82D_uvXTmVamK9oUEQ-3x5b+759HMz4jv92o86opfw@mail.gmail.com>

Anyone seeing connectivity issues with Savvis in the Chicago? I have
some gear in their CH3 datacenter which has been registering some
connectivity issues over the past 20 minutes or so. Cant seem to pull
up savvis.net as well from my comcast line at home either. Calling the
NOC just gives "We are experiencing higher than normal call volume".

I see traceroutes from my comcast line stopping after 350 Cermak where
it typically jumps on savvis's network.

hm...  because it's an ISP's job  to serve as the general computing IT
helpdesk for their users  and fully clarify and solve any
questions/problems that might effect their subscribers' computers
whether as a result of self-infection or end user's failure to secure
their PC......

And you should call your power company to complain if you have a burnt
out lightbulb in your kitchen.

Or is CNN footing a service bill for all their viewers  to get
personal computer repair assistance from ISPs?

Subject: [outages] St. Louis, MO - Packet Loss
Message-ID: <CAB_4pdNQAseQs3ABGZm6=K7kZdSDTGLMAPp75-rcS8vkaKrpBw@mail.gmail.com>

According to Sprint's Network Performance
page<https://www.sprint.net/performance/>(
https://www.sprint.net/performance/), packet loss in their St. Louis POP is
absurdly high (i.e. 61% loss to Chicago or 23% loss to Los Angeles).  If
these metrics are true, I find it hard to believe there hasn't been more
chatter on this list.  Regardless, we're experiencing difficulty reaching
various networks, which seem to be concentrated in the Central timezone.

We are seeing that connectivity from the Comcast network is fine, but most others that I have checked have 45-80% packet loss.

Internetpulse is showing some loss Verizon<->NTT and for the the past 4
hours Verizon<->Lelve(3) as well and some Sprint<->Level(3).

Looks to me like maybe something big flapped somewhere between carriers?

Yes, our external monitoring has noticed quite a few issues with Ultradns having timeout issues today. They clear up within a minute, but I was just going to open a ticket with Ultra.
We're seeing things like:

UltraDNS just sent an e-mail to customers that they are under a DDoS that took down their Hong Kong node.

AT&T said they have been doing maintenance, I called in about the cel
service issues only.

They have an ETA of about 2-3 days for completion of work, which should not
drop service but will impact services.   I would guess for 4G upgrades or
something and inability/poor-planning on the upgrades.

Duh - area is Vancouver WA area

====
Verizon customers in Henry County have experienced a service outage since
just after 3 p.m., and a member of the company's tech team told the Orion
Gazette that Verizon has no estimate of the time service will be restored.

The Verizon representative said a switch failed in Rockford, with the
failure affecting 93 cell towers in the state. Most of Illinois may be
without Verizon service.

Yes, having a lot of packet loss to a Salt Lake City HSIP circuit I have
with them..  No problem with my Denver HSIP circuit though.  I have a
ticket open with them and the tech was not aware of an outage.

Just happened again, and we've been seeing crazy packet loss through slc
on a L3 route from Kansas City to San Francisco as well. Something has
been broken in SLC since at least 8:50 AM Central.

I am not sure if it is related to your packet loss, but we received
word that L3 has a fiber mess in Tucson, AZ where a splice case and
fiber were stolen around 1:20 PST.  No ETR on that yet.

Possible congestion on remaining routes?

Hello,

We're seeing issues with many providers in the SF Bay Area which
include, but apear to not be limited to:

- Abovenet (Zayo)
- Telia

I'm also seeing what appears to be peering issues with Comcast but
that is more gut than anything.

Is anyone able to corroborate?

Got hit by that as well. Latest update is that alarms are starting to clear as splicing continues.

Hi Ravi -

We are seeing plenty of issues too, some things dying in GLBX or
twtelecom between our office in the North bay and Sacramento.  Also
regular trouble getting to Yahoo!, some google, gotomeetin/citrix.  Our
network provider is Telepacific.net

Some traceroutes in case they help someone.  I can ssh to a data center
in SFO, and then get to our provider in Sac (herakles) - so there are
things afoot somewhere in between the other route between novato <-> sac.

thx
Scott

We're getting a few reports of a customers, one we've confirmed is located in Palo Alto, unable to reach our Chicago-hosted service, while all of our monitoring reports our services are up from here. 

Nothing concrete, but seems like it might be related to the issues you're talking about.

I was getting random grief with traffic going via my Global Crossing
circuit that terminates in Sunnyvale (couldn't resolve Yahoo DNS for
one). Rerouting via Sprint mitigated most of it for me.

We're still seeing issues on connectivity into the SF and Sacramento area
via GLX as well.  Has anyone been able to isolate this down to
specifically a GLX issue, or if there is something more widespread across
multiple carriers?  So far we do not seem to have the same issue via the
legacy Level3 network.

Just for fun I called Global Crossing regarding my circuit and I'm still
in the initial pick up hold loop after 20 minutes. So I'm guessing
they're busy. Their online tool for reading master tickets just returns
"Error trying to retrieve Cases".

I've kicked the BGP prefs on my circuit with them to a minimum and
things are better for me.

Ah, it finally loaded. San Jose, CA an automated tool made unexpected
config changes that inadvertently impacted IP Services.

Thanks; that's consistent with what I'm (still) seeing, and more than
we've gotten out of them.

Message-ID: <50102A0E.3070001@vantage.com>

I've lost some VZB circuits between downtown Philadelphia and Malvern, 
PA.  I mention only because VZ has correlated my woes to a higher-level 
outage (with no details....) and I'm hearing persistent tales that VZW 
service is also gone in the western suburbs of Philadelphia.  My 
circuits dropped at 16:07 GMT.

I've just founded (isn't the informality of the Internet wonderful) NATOG:
The North American Telephony Operators Group, for people who deal with 
telephony equipment, services and networks both from the customer and the
carrier perspective.

At the moment, it's just an IRC channel:  irc://irc.freenode.net#natog

to which all telecom people are welcome.  I expect more stuff will happen
at some point.  I'd specifically like to see carrier people there, to the
extent that it won't get them fired.

It's possibly out well past Malvern.  No real details, but wife's work
in Coatesville linked to "multiple client outage" per VZB cs rep.
As usual, no eta, scale, etc.

To summarize the statements of Lee Gierczynski, Verizon spokesperson, a 
power outage in a Wayne Pa facility disrupted voice and data services in 
Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery counties.  As of his statements, they 
did not know why circuit breakers had tripped, and while they'd restored 
power, they hadn't yet managed to restart all the equipment.  The 
original ETR was 5pm ET, but they've gone skidding past that with my 
circuits.  Other reports are that maybe they've not restored power yet 
and had retreated to not having an ETR.  (I dislike having to depend on 
the general press to explain outages to me.)

And yes, 911 service was/is disrupted.  :-(
And no, unlike in N. Virginia a couple of weeks ago, they don't even 
have a big storm to blame this one on.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Hi,

wiki.outages.org has recently been experiencing slowness & at times
out of connection due to the lack of resources. In order to address
memory/cpu utilization issues we have decided to move it to a cloud
service.

Why? Scalability - In the future we will be able to address resource
related issues by dynamically scaling the resource window w/o having
to do a fork lift. The another benefit of moving to a cloud service is
the ability to distribute the load between different regions, which is
currently running off a single region.

Having said that, in coming weeks we will be migrating the server to
cloud with kind donation from PhoenixNAP.

More update to follow & grateful thanks for your support.


regards,

Cincinnati specifically.  Could just be the tower we are on (not to

Anyone else in the area or with gear here can confirm ?

Also - anyone know of/if VZW has any kind of decent status page ?

Thanks in advance.

Looking at our logs here, not seeing any problem - steady flow of mail to 
yahoo.com addresses with successful deliveries. Going mostly all through:

mta5.am0.yahoodns.net
mta6.am0.yahoodns.net
mta7.am0.yahoodns.net

SMTP is probably fine.  This is most likely IMAP/web access for users.

Same here on TWC in San Diego.  Also, looks like IMAP access is down as well.

We analyze our queues hourly, and at 12:17 pm Central we had a good number
of messages for yahoo.com in our outbound queues, all because of "connection
refused" or "connection reset by peer".

So there definitely is/was something amiss.

Yeah, Frank, we're seeing intermittent SMTP as well.  My guess is they are going to be unstable for a bit until a huge backlog is cleared.  I'm sure the India grid outage today isn't helping them either considering how many users they have there.
